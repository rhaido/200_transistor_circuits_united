# TRANSISTOR CIRCUITS, Part II

## RECTIFYING a VOLTAGE

![RectifierCcts-1](images/RectifierCcts-1-bw.png)

![RectifierCcts-1](images/RectifierCcts-2-bw.png)

These circuits show how to change an oscillating voltage (commonly called AC)
to DC. The term AC means Alternating Current but it really means Alternating
Voltage as the rising and falling voltage produces an increasing and
decreasing current.

The term DC means Direct Current but it actually means Direct or unchanging
Voltage.

The output of the following circuits will not be pure DC (like that from a
battery) but will contain ripple. Ripple is reduced by adding a capacitor
(electrolytic) to the output.

## DARK DETECTOR with Beep-Beep-Beep Alarm

![Alarm-Beep-Beep](images/Alarm-Beep-Beep.png)

This circuit detects darkness and produces a beep-beep-beep alarm. The
first two transistors form a high-gain amplifier with feedback via the 4u7
to produce a low-frequency oscillator. This provides voltage for the second
oscillator (across the 1k resistor) to drive a speaker.

## Project can turn ON when DARK

![DarkforProjectTurn-On](images/DarkforProjectTurn-On.png)

This circuit detects darkness and allows the
project to turn on. The project can be any circuit that operates from 3v
to 12v.

The components have been chosen for a 6v project that requires 500mA.

## 3-PHASE SINEWAVE GENERATOR

![3-PhaseSinewaveModified](images/3-PhaseSinewaveModified.png)

This circuit produces a sinewave and each phase can be tapped at the point
shown. The secret to producing a good waveform is the addition of the 2k2
resistor in the 0v rail This circuit and waveform is provided by Jack Hoffnung.

![3-PhaseWaveform](images/3-PhaseWaveform.jpg)

Two of the three waveforms - we only have dual trace CRO's !!!!

## TRANSFORMERLESS POWER SUPPLY

![TransformerlessPowerSupply](images/TransformerlessPowerSupply.png)

This clever design uses 4 diodes in a bridge to produce a fixed voltage
power supply capable of supplying 35mA.

All diodes (every type of diode) are zener diodes. They all break down at a
particular voltage. The fact is, a power diode breaks down at 100v or 400v
and its zener characteristic is not useful.

But if we put 2 zener diodes in a bridge with two ordinary power diodes,
the bridge will break-down at the voltage of the zener. This is what we have
done. If we use 18v zeners, the output will be 17v4.

When the incoming voltage is positive at the top, the left zener provides
18v limit (and the other zener produces a drop of 0.6v) This allows the right
zener to pass current just like a normal diode. The output is 17v4. The same
with the other half-cycle.

The current is limited by the value of the X2 capacitors and this is
7mA for each 100n when in full-wave (as per this circuit). We have 1u
capacitance. Theoretically the circuit will supply 70mA but we found it will
only deliver 35mA before the output drops. The capacitors should comply with
X1 or X2 class. The 10R is a safety-fuse resistor.

The problem with this power supply is the "live" nature of the negative
rail. When the power supply is connected as shown, the negative rail is 0.7v
above neutral. If the mains is reversed, the negative rail is 340v (peak) above
neutral and this will kill you as the current will flow through the diode
and be lethal. You need to touch the negative rail (or the positive rail)
and any earthed device such as a toaster to get killed. The only solution
is the project being powered must be totally enclosed in a box with no outputs.

A **TRANSFORMERLESS POWER SUPPLY** is also called a **CAPACITOR FED POWER
SUPPLY**.  It is very dangerous.

Here's why:

A **Capacitor Power Supply** uses a capacitor to interface between a “high
voltage supply” and a low voltage – called THE POWER SUPPLY.

In other words a capacitor is placed between a “high voltage supply” we
call THE MAINS (between 110v and 240v) and a low voltage that may be 9v to 12v.
Even though a capacitor consists of two plates that do not touch each other,
a **Capacitor Power Supply** is a very dangerous project, for two reasons.

You may not think electricity can pass though a capacitor because it consists
of plates that do not touch each other.

But a capacitor works in a slightly different way. A capacitor connected to
the mains works like this: Consider a magnet on one side of a door. On the
other side we have a sheet of metal. As you slide the magnet up the door,
the sheet of metal rises too.

The same with a capacitor. As the voltage on one side of the capacitor
rises, the voltage on the other side is “pulled out of the ground” -
and it rises too.

If you stand on the ground and hold one lead of the capacitor and connect the
other to the active side of the “mains,” the capacitor will “pull”
120v or 240v “out of the ground” and you will get a shock.

Don’t ask “how” or “why.” This is just the simplest way to describe
how you get a shock via a capacitor that consists of two plates.

If the capacitor “shorts” between the two plates, the 120v or 240v will
be delivered to your power supply and create damage.

Secondly, if any of the components in your power supply become open-circuit,
the voltage on the power supply will increase.  But the most dangerous
feature of this type of power supply is reversal of the mains leads.

The circuit is designed so that the neutral lead goes to the earth of your
power supply.

This means the active is connected to the capacitor.

Now, the way the active works is this: The active lead rises 120x 1.4 =
180v in the positive direction and then drops to 180v in the opposite
direction. In other words it is 180v higher than the neutral line then 180v
lower than the neutral.

For 240v mains, this is 325v higher then 325v lower.  The neutral is connected
to the chassis of your project and if you touch it, nothing will happen. It
does not rise or fall.

But suppose you connect the power leads around the wrong way.

The active is now connected to the chassis and if you touch the chassis and
a water pipe, you will get a 180v or 345v shock.

That’s why a CAPACITOR-FED power supply must be totally isolated.  Now we
come to the question: How does a capacitor produce a 12v power supply?
When a capacitor is connected to the mains, one lead is rising and falling.
Depending on the size of the capacitor, it will allow current to flow into
and out of the other lead.

If the capacitor is a large value, a high current will flow into and out of
the lead. In addition, a high voltage will allow a higher current to flow.

This current is “taken out of the ground” and “flows back into the
ground.” It does not come from the mains. The mains only: “influences”
the flow of current.

Thus we have a flow of current into and out of the capacitor.

If you put a resistor between the capacitor and “ground,” the amount of
current that will flow, depends on 3 things, the amplitude of the voltage,
the size of the capacitor and the speed of the rise and fall.

When current flows through a resistor, a voltage develops across the resistor
and if we select the correct value of resistance, we will get a 12v power
supply.

### THE OUTPUT VOLTAGE

The OUTPUT VOLTAGE of all transformerless power supplies will be about 50%
HIGHER than the mains voltage if a LOAD is not connected. That's RIGHT:
The output of a 120v CAPACITOR POWER SUPPLY (transformerless power supply)
will be about 180v and a 240v mains transformerless power supply will be
about 345v.  How do you get a 12v or 24v supply????

It works like this: The transformerless power supply is a CURRENT-DELIVERED
power supply. In other words we have to talk about CURRENT-VALUES and not
voltages.

For a bridge circuit (called a full-wave design) it will deliver 7mA for
each 100n. Suppose we have 220n. We have 15mA available.

We take the 15mA and say: How many volts will develop across a 100R load? The
answer = 0.015 x 100 = 15v. I f we use 82R the voltage will be about 12v. If we
use 220R the voltage will be 33v. That's how the output voltage is developed.

If you add another 220n across the 220n, the voltages will be DOUBLE. It's
as simple as that.

## LEDs on 240v

![LEDs-on-240v](images/LEDs-on-240v.png)

I do not like any circuit connected directly to 240v mains. However
Christmas tress lights have been connected directly to the mains for 30
years without any major problems.

Insulation must be provided and the lights (LEDs) must be away from prying
fingers.

You need at least 50 LEDs in each string to prevent them being damaged via
a surge through the 1k resistor - if the circuit is turned on at the peak
of the waveform. As you add more LEDs to each string, the current will drop
a very small amount until eventually, when you have 90 LEDs in each string,
the current will be zero.

For 50 LEDs in each string, the total characteristic voltage will be 180v
so that the peak voltage will be 330v - 180v = 150v. Each LED will see less
than 7mA peak during the half-cycle they are illuminated. The 1k resistor will
drop 7v - since the RMS current is 7mA (7mA x 1,000 ohms = 7v). No rectifier
diodes are needed. The LEDs are the "rectifiers." Very clever. You must have
LEDs in both directions to charge and discharge the capacitor. The resistor
is provided to take a heavy surge current through one of the strings of LEDs
if the circuit is switched on when the mains is at a peak.

This can be as high as 330mA if only 1 LED is used, so the value of this
resistor must be adjusted if a small number of LEDs are used. The LEDs above
detect peak current.

**A 100n cap will deliver 7mA RMS or 10mA peak in full wave or 3.5mA RMS
(10mA peak for half a cycle) in half-wave**. (when only 1 LED is in each string).

![CapacitorSupply](images/CapacitorSupply.png)

The current-capability of a capacitor needs more explanation. In the diagram
on the left we see a capacitor feeding a full-wave power supply. This is
exactly the same as the LEDs on 240v circuit above. Imagine the LOAD resistor
is removed. Two of the diodes will face down and two will face up. This
is exactly the same as the LEDs facing up and facing down in the circuit
above. The only difference is the mid-point is joined. Since the voltage on
the mid-point of one string is the same as the voltage at the mid-point of the
other string, the link can be removed and the circuit will operate the same.

This means each 100n of capacitance will deliver 7mA RMS (10mA peak on
each half-cycle).  In the half-wave supply, the capacitor delivers 3.5mA
RMS (10mA peak on each half-cycle, but one half-cycle is lost in the diode)
for each 100n to the load, and during the other half-cycle the 10mA peak is
lost in the diode that discharges the capacitor.

You can use any LEDs and try to keep the total voltage-drop in each string
equal. Each string is actually working on DC. It's not constant DC but
varying DC. In fact is it zero current for 1/2 cycle then nothing until
the voltage rises above the total characteristic voltage of all the LEDs,
then a gradual increase in current over the remainder of the cycle, then
a gradual decrease to zero over the falling portion of the cycle, then
nothing for 1/2 cycle. Because the LEDs turn on and off, you may observe
some flickering and that's why the two strings should be placed together.

## BOOK LIGHT

![BookLight](images/BookLight.png)

This circuit keeps the globe illuminated for a few seconds after the switch is
pressed.

There is one minor fault in the circuit. The 10k should be increased to 100k
to increase the "ON" time.

<!--full-->The photo shows the circuit built with surface-mount components:

<!--full-->![BookLight](images/BookLight.jpg)

## CAMERA ACTIVATOR

This circuit was designed for a customer who wanted to trigger a camera after
a short delay.

![CameraActivator](images/CameraActivator.png)

The output goes HIGH about 2 seconds after the switch is pressed. The LED turns
on for about 0.25 seconds.  The circuit will accept either active HIGH or LOW
input and the switch can remain pressed and it will not upset the operation of
the circuit. The timing can be changed by adjusting the 1M trim pot and/or
altering the value of the 470k.

## POWER SUPPLIES - FIXED

![5vSupplies-fixed](images/5vSupplies-fixed.png)

A simple power supply can be made with a component called a "3-pin
regulator or 3-terminal regulator" It will provide a very low ripple output
(about 4mV to 10mV provided electrolytics are on the input and output.

The diagram above shows how to connect a regulator to create a power
supply. The 7805 regulators can handle 100mA, 500mA and 1 amp, and produce
an output of 5v, as shown.

These regulators are called linear regulators and drop about 4v across them -
minimum. If the current flow is 1 amp, 4watts of heat must be dissipated via
a large heatsink. If the output is 5v and input 12v, 7volts will be dropped
across the regulator and 7watts must be dissipated.

## POWER SUPPLIES - ADJUSTABLE

![5vSupplies-adj](images/5vSupplies-adj.png)

The LM317 regulators are adjustable and produce an output from 1.25 to about
35v. The LM317T regulator will deliver up to 1.5amp.

## POWER SUPPLIES - ADJUSTABLE using 7805

![5vSupplies-jackUp](images/5vSupplies-jackUp.png)

The 7805 range of regulators are called "fixed regulators" but they can be
turned into adjustable regulators by "jacking-up" their output voltage. For a
5v regulator, the output can be 5v to 30v.

## POWER SUPPLIES - ADJUSTABLE from 0v

![5vSupplies-0v](images/5vSupplies-0v.png)

The LM317 regulator is adjustable from 1.25 to about 35v. To make the output
0v to 35v, two power diodes are placed as shown in the circuit. Approx 0.6v is
dropped across each diode and this is where the 1.25v is "lost."

## LOW INPUT VOLTAGE

![LowInputVoltage](images/LowInputVoltage.png)

This clever circuit lets you know if the voltage across the regulator drops
below 2v.

This is very important when you are increasing the output voltage and the
regulator SUDDENLY drops out of regulation because the voltage across it is
insufficient.

This can be due to the ripple causing the problem and you will see the green
LED flickering.

You can add extra diodes in series with the LED to get a safety margin of 2.6v
or 3.2v The 220R on the output is only needed when the output is not loaded and
the current taken by the LED needs to be brought from the 0v rail as the output
does not like to dragged higher than 5v (or its present output voltage).

## 5v POWER SUPPLY

![5vSupplies-5v](images/5vSupplies-5v.png)

Using the the LM317 regulator to produce 5v supply (5.04v):

## CONSTANT CURRENT

![ConstantCurrent](images/ConstantCurrent.png)

This constant current circuit can be adjusted to any value from a few milliamp
to about 500mA - this is the limit of the BC337 transistor.

The circuit can also be called a current-limiting circuit and is ideal in a
bench power supply to prevent the circuit you are testing from being damaged.

Approximately 4v is dropped across the regulator and 1.25v across the
current-limiting section, so the input voltage (supply) has to be 5.25v above
the required output voltage. Suppose you want to charge 4 Ni-Cad cells. Connect
them to the output and adjust the 500R pot until the required charge-current is
obtained.

The charger will now charge 1, 2, 3 or 4 cells at the same current. But you
must remember to turn off the charger before the cells are fully charged as the
circuit will not detect this and over-charge the cells.

The LM 317 3-terminal regulator will need to be heatsinked.

This circuit is designed for the LM series of regulator as they have a voltage
differential of 1.25v between "adj" and "out" terminals.

7805 regulators can be used but the losses in the BC337 will be 4 times
greater as the voltage across it will be 5v.

## THE POWER SUPPLY

![PowerSupply-1](images/PowerSupply-1.png)

The simplest power supply is a transformer, diode and electrolytic: But the
ripple will be very high because only every alternate portion of the ac signal
is being passed through the diode and the electrolytic (called the filter
capacitor) cannot smooth the ripple very well. The result will be a loud hum if
powering an amplifier.

An improvement is to use a bridge rectifier. This will reduce the ripple and
reduce the hum because the waveform to the electrolytic consists of pulses that
are closer together and the electrolytic does not have to supply as much energy
because the pulses are closer together.

![PowerSupply-2](images/PowerSupply-2.png)

### ZENER REGULATION

The next improvement is to reduce the ripple with a zener diode.

The zener diode is placed across the voltage you want to smooth and as the
voltage increases, the zener diode turns ON more and additional current flows
through it to the 0v rail. This reduces the voltage but the result is a
smoother voltage.

This is called a SHUNT REGULATOR or ZENER SHUNT REGULATOR or ZENER DIODE
STABILIZER.

![PowerSupply-3](images/PowerSupply-3.png)

In place of a zener, we can use a transistor.

### THE SHUNT TRANSISTOR

A transistor placed across the voltage to be regulated (or stabilized)
is called a SHUNT TRANSISTOR, because it shunts or sends the unwanted extra
waveform to the 0v rail, and thereby smoothes the voltage.

It uses a zener to sense the voltage as in the zener regulator circuit above,
but the current through the zener is less because the transistor turns ON
and reduces the voltage. A lower-wattage zener diode can be used and since
less current flows through it, the voltage across it will be more stable.

This arrangement is better than a zener diode regulator due the improved
stability of the diode with less current flowing through it and the circuit
will deliver about 100 times more current due to the inclusion of the
transistor.

However, this circuit is very wasteful because the maximum current is flowing
all the time and being sent to the 0v rail. When you add a load (such as
an amplifier), the current is diverted from the shunt transistor and into
the amplifier. The amplifier can only take current up to the maximum the
transistor was passing to the 0v rail.

![PowerSupply-4](images/PowerSupply-4.png)

### THE PASS TRANSISTOR

A PASS TRANSISTOR is less wasteful than a SHUNT TRANSISTOR. The circuit
takes almost no current (when the amplifier is not connected).

The ripple on the output is determined by the effectiveness of the zener
(due to the low current is is required to pass) and the transistor (passes
this voltage and) amplifies the current about 100 times.

![PowerSupply-5](images/PowerSupply-5.png)

No values have been provided for these circuits are they are intended to
explain Shunt Transistor and Pass Transistor. The type of transistor and
value of resistor in the power line will depend on the current.

## THE ELECTRONIC FILTER

![ElectronicFilter](images/ElectronicFilter.png)

Here is a simple circuit to reduce the ripple from a power supply by a factor
of about 100. This means a 20mV ripple will be 0.2mV and will not be noticed.
This is important when you are powering an FM bug from a plug pack. The
background hum is annoying and very difficult to remove with electrolytics.
This circuit is the answer. The 1k and 100u form a filter that makes the 100u
one hundred times more effective than if placed directly on the supply-line.
The transistor detects the voltage on the base and also detects the very small
ripple.

As current is taken by the load, about 100th of this current is required by
the base and if the load current is 100mA, the current into the base will
be 1mA and one volt will be dropped across the 1k resistor.

The circuit is suitable for up to 100mA. A power transistor can be used, but
the 1k will have to be reduced to 220R for 500mA output. The output of the
circuit is about 2v less than the output of the plug pack.  By adding a zener
across the electro, the output voltage will remain much more constant (fixed).

If a zener is not added, the output voltage will drop as the current
increases due to a factor called REGULATION. This is the inability of the
small transformer to provide a constant voltage. The addition of the 3
components only reduces the RIPPLE portion of the voltage - and does not
change the fact that the voltage will droop when current is increased. It
requires a zener to fix this problem.

This circuit can also be called: RIPPLE SUPPRESSOR, RIPPLE REDUCER or
CAPACITANCE MULTIPLIER. The 100u can be increased to 470u or 1,000u.

## 5v FROM OLD CELLS - Circuit 1

![5v-from-old-cells](images/5v-from-old-cells.png)

This circuit takes the place of a 78L05 3-terminal regulator. It produces a
constant 5v @ 100mA. You can use any old cells and get the last of their
energy. Use an 8-cell holder. The voltage from 8 old cells will be about 10v
and the circuit will operate down to about 7.5v. The regulation is very good at
10v, only dropping about 10mV for 100mA current flow (the 78L05 has 1mV drop).
As the voltage drops, the output drops from 5v on no-load to 4.8v and 4.6v on
100mA current-flow. The pot can be adjusted to compensate for the voltage-drop.
This type of circuit is called a LINEAR REGULATOR and is not very efficient
(about 50% in this case). See Circuit 2 below for BUCK REGULATOR circuit (about
85% efficient).

## 5v FROM OLD CELLS - Circuit 2

![BuckRegulator](images/BuckRegulator.png)

This circuit is a BUCK REGULATOR. It can take the place of a 78L05 3-terminal
regulator, but it is more efficient. It produces a constant 5v @ up to 200mA.
You can use any old cells and get the last of their energy. Use an 8-cell
holder. The voltage from 8 old cells will be about 10v and the circuit will
operate down to about 7.5v. The regulation is very good at 10v, only dropping
10mV for up to 200mA output.

<!--full-->![BuckRegulator](images/BuckRegulator.jpg)

## INCREASING THE OUTPUT CURRENT

![HighCurrentPowerSupply](images/HighCurrentPowerSupply.png)

The output current of all 3-terminal regulators can be increased by including a
pass transistor. This transistor simply allows the current to flow through the
collector-emitter leads.  The output voltage is maintained by the 3-terminal
regulator but the current flows through the "pass transistor." This transistor
is a power transistor and must be adequately heatsinked.

Normally a 2N3055 or TIP3055 is used for this application as it will handle
up to 10 amps and creates a 10 amp power supply. The regulator can be 78L05
as all the current is delivered by the pass transistor.

## SOFT START

![SoftStart](images/SoftStart.png)

The output voltage of a 3-terminal regulator can be designed to rise slowly.
This has very limited application as many circuits do not like this.

## TURN-OFF DELAY

![DelayTurnOff](images/DelayTurnOff.png)

These 4 circuits are all the same. They supply power
to a project for a short period of time. You can select either PNP or NPN
transistors or Darlington transistors. The output voltage gradually dies
and this will will produce weird effects with some projects. See circuit
4 in Time Delay Circuits (below) for a relay that remains active for a few
seconds after the push button has been released.

## TIME DELAY CIRCUITS

![TimeDelay-Ccts](images/TimeDelay-Ccts.png)

These 3 circuits are all the same. They turn on a relay after a period of time.

The aim of the circuit is to charge the electrolytic to a reasonably high
voltage before the circuit turns ON. In fig 1 the voltage will be above 5v6. In
fig 2 the voltage will be above 3v6. In fig 3 the voltage will be above 7v.

![TimeDelay4](images/TimeDelay4.png)

The relay in this circuit will remain active for a few seconds after the
push button has been released.

The value of the 1k resistor and electrolytic can be adjusted to suit
individual requirements.

## LED DETECTS LIGHT 2

![LEDdetectsLight](images/LEDdetectsLight.png)

The LED in this circuit will detect light to turn on the oscillator. Ordinary
red LEDs do not work. But green LEDs, yellow LEDs and high-bright white LEDs
and high-bright red LEDs work very well.

The output voltage of the LED is up to 600mV when detecting very bright
illumination.  When light is detected by the LED, its resistance decreases
and a very small current flows into the base of the first transistor. The
transistor amplifies this current about 200 times and the resistance between
collector and emitter decreases. The 330k resistor on the collector is a
current limiting resistor as the middle transistor only needs a very small
current for the circuit to oscillate. If the current is too high, the circuit
will "freeze."

The piezo diaphragm does not contain any active components and relies on
the circuit to drive it to produce the tone. A different [LED DETECTS LIGHT]
circuit in the first part of this eBook.

## TRAIN DETECTORS

![TrainDetector](images/TrainDetector.png)

In response to a reader who wanted to parallel TRAIN DETECTORS, here is a diode
OR-circuit. The resistor values on each detector will need to be adjusted
(changed) according to the voltage of the supply and the types of detector
being used. Any number of detectors can be added. See Talking Electronics
website for train circuits and kits including Air Horn, Capacitor Discharge
Unit for operating point motors without overheating the windings, Signals,
Pedestrian Crossing Lights and many more.

## TRACK POLARITY

![TrackPolarity](images/TrackPolarity.png)

This circuit shows the polarity of a track via a 3-legged LED. The LED is
called dual colour (or tri-colour) as it shows red in one direction and green
in the other (orange when both LEDs are illuminated).

## DECAYING FLASHER

![DecayingFreq555](images/DecayingFreq555.png)

In response to a reader who wanted a flashing LED circuit
that slowed down when a button was released, the above circuit increases
the flash rate to a maximum and when the button is released, the flash rate
decreases to a minimum and halts.

## SIMPLE FLASHER

![Flasher-simple](images/Flasher-simple.png)

This simple circuit flashes a globe at a rate according
to the value of the 180R and 2200u electrolytic.

## LATCHING RELAY

To reduce the current in battery operated equipment a
relay called LATCHING RELAY can be used. This is a relay that latches itself
ON when it receives a pulse in one direction and unlatches itself when it
receives a pulse in the other direction.

The following diagram shows how the coil makes the magnet click in the
two directions.

![latching-Relay](images/latching-Relay.png)

![PulseLatchingRelay](images/PulseLatchingRelay.png)

To operate this type of relay, the voltage must be reversed to unlatch
it. The circuit above produces a strong pulse to latch the relay ON and the
input voltage must remain HIGH. The 220u gradually charges and the current
falls to a very low level. When the input voltage is removed, the circuit
produces a pulse in the opposite direction to unlatch the relay.

The pulse-latching circuit above can be connected to a microcontroller via
the circuit down here. The electrolytic can be increased to 1,000u to
cater for relays with a low resistance.

![PulseLatchingRelay-2](images/PulseLatchingRelay-2.png)

If you want to latch an ordinary relay so it remains ON after a pulse, the
next circuits can be used. Power is needed all the time to keep the relay ON.

![latching-Relay-2](images/latching-Relay-2.png)

If your latching relay latches when it receives a 50mS pulse and unlatches
when it receives a 50mS pulse in the opposite direction, you just need a
reversing switch and a push button. You just need to flick the switch to
the latch or unlatch position and push the button very quickly.

![LatchWithSw](images/LatchWithSw.png)

To operate a latching relay from a signal, you need the following circuit:

![LatchWith2Relays](images/LatchWith2Relays.png)

To use this circuit you have to understand some of the technical requirements.

When the signal is HIGH it has driving power and is classified a low impedance
and it will only turn ON the BC547. If you make sure the signal is HIGH when
the circuit is turned ON, you will have no problem.

But if the signal is LOW when the 12v power is applied, the signal-line will
be effectively "floating" and the four 1k resistors in series will turn on
both transistors.

The 10u is designed to delay to BC547 and it will produce the longer pulse to
de-activate the relay.  You will have to adjust the value of the resistors and
electrolytics to get the required pulse length and the required delay. This
circuit is just a "starting-point."

This circuit has been requested by: Stephen Derrick-Jehu email: [d-js@xtra.co.nz]
Contact him for the success of this circuit, with his 8 ohm 12v EHCOTEC
valve B23E-1-ML-4.5vDC.

Specifications:

- 4.5-Volt DC minimum coil voltage
- 12-Volt DC maximum coil voltage
- 50 mS (min) pulse opens valve
- 50 mS pulse (min) with reverse polarity closes valve
- 2.5 W power consumption at 4.5vDC

The following circuit pulses a latching relay every 30 seconds. The circuit
only consumes current during the 50mS latching period.

![50mS-Reversal](images/50mS-Reversal.png)

The values for the timing components have not been provided. These can be
worked out by experimentation.

Latching Relays are expensive but a 5v Latching Relay is available from:
Excess Electronics for $1.00 as a surplus item. It has 2 coils and requires
the circuit at the left. A 5v Latching Relay can be use on 12v as it is
activated for a very short period of time.

![latching-Relay-3](images/latching-Relay-3.png)

A double-pole (ordinary) relay and transistor can be connected to provide
a toggle action.

![latching-Relay-4](images/latching-Relay-4.png)

The circuit comes on with the relay de-activated and the contacts connected
so that the 470u charges via the 3k3. Allow the 470u to charge. By pressing
the button, the BC547 will activate the relay and the contacts will change
so that the 3k3 is now keeping the transistor ON.  The 470u will discharge
via the 1k. After a few seconds the electro will be discharged. If the
press-button is now pushed for a short period of time, the transistor will
turn off due to the electro being discharged.

A single-coil latching relay normally needs a reverse-voltage to unlatch
but the following circuit provides forward and reverse voltage by using
2 transistors in a very clever H-design.

![latching-Relay-5](images/latching-Relay-5.png)

The pulse-ON and pulse-OFF can be provided from two lines of the
microcontroller.

A normal relay can be activated by a short tone and de-activated by a long
tone as shown via the circuit on the left. This circuit can be found in
"27MHz Links" Page 2.

![latching-Relay-6](images/latching-Relay-6.png)

The following circuit will come ON in either SET or RESET state,
depending on the state of the armature in the relay.

![latching-Relay-7](images/latching-Relay-7.png)

If it comes ON in RESET state, the 2k2 on the SET coil will charge the 22u
electrolytic so that when the switch is pressed, the 22u will activate the SET
coil and change the state of the relay. The opposite 22u will not get charged
and when the switch is pressed after a few seconds, relay will change state.

The relay is SY4060 from Jarcar Electronics.

## LATCH - ELECTRONIC LATCH - LATCH A SIGNAL

![Latch-Ccts](images/Latch-Ccts.png)

When the circuit sees a voltage about 1v or higher, the circuit latches ON and
illuminates the LED or relay. The third circuit provides SET and RESET. The
fourth circuit provides SET and RESET via a bi-stable arrangement.

## LATCHING A PUSH BUTTON - also called: PUSH-ON PUSH-OFF

![LatchingPushButton](images/LatchingPushButton.png)

When the circuit is turned on, capacitor C1 charges via the two 470k resistors.
When the switch is pressed, the voltage on C1 is passed to Q3 to turn it on.
This turns on Q1 and the voltage developed across R7 will keep Q1 turned on
when the button is released.

Q2 is also turned on during this time and it discharges the capacitor. When
the switch is pressed again, the capacitor is in a discharged state and this
zero voltage will be passed to Q3 turn it off. This turns off Q1 and Q2 and
the capacitor begins to charge again to repeat the cycle.

## TOGGLE A PUSH BUTTON - using 2 relays

![ToggleRelay](images/ToggleRelay.png)

The circuit is shown with the second relay "active."

Half of each relay is used for the toggle function and the other half can
be connected to an application.

The first relay (which is off), applies voltage from its contacts and
latches the second relay “on”. The condition changes when the switch
is pressed. Voltage is applied to the first relay, latching it “on.”
Releasing the switch turns the second relay “off”.

When the switch is pressed again, 12v is applied to both ends of the first
relay and it turns off. The second relay turns “on” when the switch
is released. There is slight lag in the action, depending on how long the
switch is pressed.

## TOGGLE A RELAY

![ToggleArelay](images/ToggleArelay.png)

This circuit will activate a relay when the switch is
pressed and released quickly and turn the relay off when the switch is
pressed for about 1 second then released.

The circuit relies on a few component values to operate correctly and they
may need to be adjusted to get the circuit to operate exactly as required.

When the switch is pressed, The BC557 turns ON and supplies nearly rail
voltage to the relay.

This closes the contacts and the BC547 is capable of delivering a current
to the relay.

The transistor acts just like a resistor with a resistance equal to 1/250
the value of the base resistor. This is 40 ohms. If the relay has a coil
resistance of 250 ohms, it will see a voltage of about 10v for a 12v supply.

When the switch is released, the BC547 keeps the relay energised.

During this activation, the 220u electrolytic helps in activating the relay.

Here's how: Initially the 220u is charged (quite slowly) via the 10k resistor
68 ohm resistor and the coil of the relay.

It is now fully charged and when the switch is pressed, the negative end
of the electrolytic is raised via the collector of the BC557. The positive
end rises too and this action raises the emitter and when the relay contacts
close, the relay is delivered current fro both the BC557 and and BC547. When
the sw is released, the BC547 takes over and the discharging of the 220u
into the base, holds the relay closed.

As the 220u gradually discharges, the ability of the BC547 to deliver current
reduces slightly and the 10k base resistor takes over and turns the transistor
into a 40R resistor.  Finally the 220u has a very small voltage across it.

When the switch is pressed again, the BC547 acts as a resistor with a
resistance less than 40 ohms and it is able to deliver a voltage slightly
higher than that provided by the BC547.

This slightly higher voltage is passed to the negative lead of the 220u and
the positive lead actually rises about rail voltage and the electro gets
discharged via the 10k resistor.

When the switch is released, the electro has less than 0.6v across it and
the BC547 transistor is not able to deliver current to the relay. The relay
is de-activated.

## REVERSING A MOTOR - 1

There are a number of ways to reverse a motor. The following diagrams show how
to connect a double-pole double throw relay or switch and a set of 4 push
buttons. The two buttons must be pushed at the same time or two double pole
push-switches can be used.

See H-Bridge below for more ways to reverse a motor.

![ReversingRelay](images/ReversingRelay.png)

Adding limit switches:

![ReversinRelayAndSwitch](images/ReversingRelay_and_Switch.png)

The way the dpdt relay circuit (above) works is this: The relay is powered by
say 12v, via a MAIN SWITCH. When the relay is activated, the motor travels in
the forward direction and hits the "up limit" switch. The motor stops. When the
MAIN SWITCH is turned off, the relay is de-activated and reverses the motor
until it reaches th e "down-limit" switch and stops. The MAIN SWITCH must be
used to send the motor to the "up limit" switch.

## REVERSING A MOTOR-2

### AUTOMATIC FORWARD-REVERSE

The following circuit allows a motor (such as a train) to travel in the forward
direction until it hits the "up limit" switch. This sends a pulse to the
latching relay to reverse the motor (and ends the short pulse). The train
travels to the "down limit" switch and reverses.

![Reversing-A-Motor](images/Reversing-A-Motor.png)

If the motor can be used to click a switch or move a slide switch, the
following circuit can be used:

![Reversing-A-Motor-2](images/Reversing-A-Motor-2.png)

## REVERSING A MOTOR-3

If the train cannot physically click the slide switch in both directions, via a
linkage, the following circuit should be used:

![Reversing-A-Motor-3](images/Reversing-A-Motor-3.png)

When power is applied, the relay is not energised and the train must travel
towards the "up limit." The switch is pressed and the relay is energised. The
Normally Open contacts of the relay will close and this will keep the relay
energised and reverse the train. When the down limit is pressed, the relay is
de-energised.

If you cannot get a triple-pole change-over relay, use the following circuit:

![Reversing-A-Motor-4](images/Reversing-A-Motor-4.png)

## AUTOMATIC BLINDS

![AutomaticBlinds](images/AutomaticBlinds.jpg)

![AutomaticBlindsCct](images/AutomaticBlindsCct.png)

This circuit can be used for anything that needs to be automatically opened or
closed via a MAINS TIMER.

Normally the Timer turns on a lamp. Our circuit uses a Wall Wart in the Mains
Timer socket and the 12v "Plug Pack" activates a 12v relay.

The relay sends (say) positive out the top lead and when the top limit switch
is opened by the motor reaching the end of its travel, it stops. The top 1N5404
prevents current passing to the motor. At 5PM the Mains timer turns the relay
OFF and it sends negative out the top lead. The top 3 amp diode allows the
motor to reverse and then the limit switch closes. When it reaches the lower
limit switch, the switch opens and the lower diode prevents current flowing to
the motor.

## BATTERY MONITOR MkI

![BatteryMonitor](images/BatteryMonitor.png)

A very simple battery monitor can be made with a dual-colour LED and a
few surrounding components. The LED produces orange when the red and green
LEDs are illuminated.

The following circuit turns on the red LED below 10.5v The orange LED
illuminates between 10.5v and 11.6v.

The green LED illuminates above 11.6v

## BATTERY MONITOR for 6v

![BatteryMonitor-6v](images/BatteryMonitor-6v.png)

The following circuit monitors a single Li-ION cell. The green LED illuminates
when the voltage is above 3.5v and the goes out when the voltage falls below
3.4v. The red LED then illuminates.

![BatteryMonitor-Ccts](images/BatteryMonitor-Ccts.png)

Adjust the 560k for the voltage at which the LED turns ON. No current-limiting
resistor is needed as the transistor only allows a few milliamp collector
curent.

## BATTERY MONITOR MkII

![BatteryMonitorMkII](images/BatteryMonitorMkII.png)

This battery monitor circuit uses 3 separate LEDs. The red LED turns on from 6v
to below 11v. It turns off above 11v and The orange LED illuminates between 11v
and 13v. It turns off above 13v; the green LED illuminates above 13v.

## LOW FUEL INDICATOR

![Fuel-Detect](images/Fuel-Detect.png)

The first circuit has been designed from a request by a reader. He wanted a low
fuel indicator for his motorbike. The LED illuminates when the fuel gauge is 90
ohms. The tank is empty at 135 ohms and full at zero ohms. To adapt the circuit
for an 80 ohm fuel sender, simply reduce the 330R to 150R. (The first thing you
have to do is measure the resistance of the sender when the tank is amply.)

The second circuit uses a power transistor to drive a lamp.

![LowFuel](images/LowFuel.png)

### HIGH FUEL INDICATOR

![HighFuel](images/HighFuel.png)

These circuits illuminates a lamp when the fuel has nearly filled the tank. It
could also activate an alarm:

![HighFuel-2](images/HighFuel-2.png)

Relay DROPS OUT when the output voltage of the fuel sender is about 0.8v.

## QUIZ TIMER

![QuizTimer](images/QuizTimer.png)

This circuit can be used to indicate: "fastest finger first." It has a globe
for each contestant and one for the Quiz Master.

When a button is pressed the corresponding globe is illuminated.

The Quiz Master globe is also illuminated and the cathode of the 9v1 zener
sees approx mid-rail voltage. The zener comes out of conduction and no
voltage appears across the 120R resistor. No other globes can be lit until
the circuit is reset.

## TRACKING TRANSMITTER

![TrackingTransmitterMkI](images/TrackingTransmitterMkI.png)

This circuit can be used to track lots of items. It has a range of 200 - 400
metres depending on the terrain and the flashing LED turns the circuit ON when
it flashes. The circuit consumes 5mA when producing a carrier (silence) and
less than 1mA when off (background snow is detected).

## BIKE TURNING SIGNAL

![bikeLeftCct](images/bikeLeftCct.png)

This circuit can be used to indicate left and right turn on a motor-bike. Two
identical circuits will be needed, one for left and one for right.

## PHONE TAPE 3

![PhoneTape-3](images/PhoneTape-3.png)

This circuit can be used to turn on a tape recorder when the phone line voltage
is less than 15v. This is the approximate voltage when the handset is picked
up. See Phone Tape-1 and Phone Tape-2 in 200 Transistor Circuits eBook
(circuits 1 - 100). When the line voltage is above 25v, the BC547 is turned on
and this robs the base of the second BC547 of the 1.2v it needs to turn on.

When the line voltage drops, the first BC547 turns off and the 10u charges via
the 47k and gradually the second BC547 is turned on. This action turns on the
BC338 and the resistance between its collector-emitter leads reduces. Two leads
are taken from the BC338 to the "rem" (remote) socket on a tape recorder. When
the lead is plugged into a tape recorder, the motor will stop. If the motor
does not stop, a second remote lead has been included with the wires connected
the opposite way. This lead will work. The audio for the tape recorder is
also shown on the diagram. This circuit has the advantage that it does not
need a battery. It will work on a 30v phone line as well as a 50v phone line.

## PHONE TAPE 4

![PhoneTape-4](images/PhoneTape-4.png)

This circuit is identical in operation to the circuit above
but uses FET's (Field Effect Transistors.  15v zeners are used to prevent
the gate of each FET from rising above 15v.

A FET has two advantages over a transistor in this type of circuit.

1. It takes very little current into the gate to turn it on. This means the
   gate resistor can be very high.
2. The voltage developed across the output
   of a FET is very low when the FET is turned on. This means the motor in the
   tape recorder will operate at full strength.

This circuit has not been tested and the 10k resistor (in series with the
first 15v zener) creates a low impedance and the circuit may not work on
some phone systems.

## SEQUENCER

![5554017Anim](images/5554017Anim-0.png)

This circuit has been requested by a reader. He wanted to have a display on his
jacket that ran 9 LEDs then stopped for 3 seconds. Note the delay produced by
the 100u and 10k produces 3 seconds by the transistor inhibiting the 555
(taking pin 6 LOW). Learn more about the 555 - see the article: "The 555" on
Talking Electronics website by clicking the title on the left index. See the
article on CD 4017. See "Chip Data eBook" on TE website in the left index.

## H-BRIDGE

These circuits reverse a motor via two input lines. Both inputs must not be LOW
with the first H-bridge circuit. If both inputs go LOW at the same time, the
transistors will "short-out" the supply. This means you need to control the
timing of the inputs. In addition, the current capability of some H-bridges is
limited by the transistor types.

![H-Bridge-1](images/H-Bridge-1.png)

## TOUCH-ON TOUCH-OFF SWITCH

![TouchON-TouchOFF](images/TouchON-TouchOFF.png)

This circuit will create a HIGH on the output
when the Touch Plate is touched briefly and produce a low when the plate is
touched again for a slightly longer period of time. Most touch switches rely
on 50Hz mains hum and do not work when the hum is not present. This circuit
does not rely on "hum."

## SIMPLE TOUCH-ON TOUCH-OFF SWITCH

![TouchON-TouchOFF-2](images/TouchON-TouchOFF-2.png)

This circuit will create a HIGH on the output when the Touch Plate is touched
briefly and produce a low when the plate is touched again.

## SHAKE TIC TAC LED TORCH

![ShakeTicTacLEDtorch](images/ShakeTicTacLEDtorch.png)

In the diagram, it looks like the coils sit on the “table” while the magnet has
its edge on the table. This is just a diagram to show how the parts are
connected. The coils actually sit flat against the slide (against the side of
the magnet) as shown in the diagram: The output voltage depends on how quickly
the magnet passes from one end of the slide to the other. That's why a rapid
shaking produces a higher voltage. You must get the end of the magnet to fully
pass though the coil so the voltage will be a maximum. That’s why the slide
extends past the coils at the top and bottom of the diagram.

The circuit consists of two 600-turn coils in series, driving a voltage
doubler. Each coil produces a positive and negative pulse, each time the magnet
passes from one end of the slide to the other.

The positive pulse charges the top electrolytic via the top diode and the
negative pulse charges the lower electrolytic, via the lower diode.

The voltage across each electrolytic is combined to produce a voltage for the
white LED. When the combined voltage is greater than 3.2v, the LED illuminates.
The electrolytics help to keep the LED illuminated while the magnet starts to
make another pass.

## FADING LED

![FadingLED](images/FadingLED.png)

The circuit fades the LED ON and OFF at an equal rate. The 470k charging and
47k discharging resistors have been chosen to create equal on and off times.

## MAINS NIGHT LIGHT

![LEDNightLight](images/LEDNightLight.png)

The circuit illuminates a column of 10 white LEDs. The 10u prevents flicker and
the 100R also reduces flicker.

## RANDOM BLINKING LEDS

![LED-Blinker](images/LED-Blinker.png)

This circuit blinks a set of LEDs in a random pattern according to the slight
differences in the three Schmitt Trigger oscillators. The CD4511 is BCD to
7-segment Driver

## HEX BUG

![HexBug-Cct](images/HexBug-Cct.png)

This is the circuit from a HEX BUG. It is a surface-mount bug
with 6 legs. The pager motor is driven by an H-Bridge and "walks" to a wall
where a feeler (consisting of a spring with a stiff wire down the middle)
causes the motor to reverse.

In the forward direction, both sets of legs are driven by the compound
gearbox but when the motor is reversed, the left legs do not operate as they
are connected by a clutch consisting of a spring-loaded inclined plane that
does not operate in reverse.

This causes the bug to turn around slightly.

The circuit also responds to a loud clap. The photo shows the 9 transistors
and accompanying components:

<!--full-->![HexBugPic-1](images/HexBugPic-1.jpg)

<!--full-->Inclined Dog Clutch.

<!--full-->![InclinedDogClutch](images/InclinedDogClutch.png)

### GEARBOX

Hex Bug gearbox consists of a compound gearbox with output "K" (eccentric pin)
driving the legs. You will need to see the project to understand how the legs
operate.

<!--full-->![HexBugGearbox](images/HexBug-Gearbox.png)
<!--full-->

When the motor is reversed, the clutch "F" is a housing that is spring-loaded
to "H" and drives "H via a square shaft "G". Gearwheel "C" is an idler and the
centre of "F" is connected to "E" via the shaft. When "E" reverses, the centre
of "F" consists of a driving inclined plane and pushes "F" towards "H" in a
clicking motion. Thus only the right legs reverse and the bug makes a turn.
When "E" is driven in the normal direction, the centre of "F" drives the outer
casing "F" via an action called an "Inclined Dog Clutch" and "F" drives "G" via
a square shaft and "G" drives "H" and "J" is an eccentric pin to drive the
legs.  The drawing of an Inclined Dog Clutch shows how the clutch drives in
only one direction. In the reverse direction it rides up on the ramp and
"clicks" once per revolution. The spring "G" in the photo keeps the two halves
together.  See Ladybug Robot in "100 IC Circuits" for an op-amp version of this
project.

## PWM CONTROLLER

![PWM-Controller-2](images/PWM-Controller-2.png)

This 555 based PWM controller features almost 0% to 100% pulse width regulation
using the 100k variable resistor, while keeping the oscillator frequency
relatively stable. The frequency is dependent on the 100k pot and 100n to give
a frequency range from about 170Hz to 200Hz.

## LIMIT SWITCHES

![LimitSw](images/LimitSw.png)

This circuit detects when the water level is low and
activates solenoid (or pump) 1 for 5 minutes (adjustable) to allow dirty
water to be diverted, before filling the tank via solenoid 2.

## WAILING SIREN

![Siren](images/Siren.png)

This circuit produces a penetrating (deafening) up/down
siren sound.

## MODEL RAILWAY TIME

![ModelRailwayTime](images/ModelRailwayTime.png)

Here is a simpler circuit than [MAKE TIME FLY!] from our
first book of 100 transistor circuits.

For those who enjoy model railways, the ultimate is to have a fast clock
to match the scale of the layout. This circuit will appear to "make time
fly" by revolving the seconds hand once every 6 seconds. The timing can be
adjusted by the electrolytics in the circuit. The electronics in the clock
is disconnected from the coil and the circuit drives the coil directly. The
circuit takes a lot more current than the original clock (1,000 times more)
but this is the only way to do the job without a sophisticated chip.

<!--full-->![ModelRailwayTime](images/ModelRailwayTime.png)

Model Railway Time Circuit Connecting the circuit to the clock coil For those
who want the circuit to take less current, here is a version using a Hex
Schmitt Trigger **74c14** chip:

![ModelRailwayTime-2](images/ModelRailwayTime-2.png)

## SLOW START-STOP

![SlowStartStop](images/SlowStartStop.png)

To make a motor start slowly and slow down slowly, this circuit can be used.
The slide switch controls the action. The Darlington transistor will need a
heatsink if the motor is loaded.

## CLAP SWITCH

![ClapSwitch](images/ClapSwitch.png)

This circuit toggles the LEDs each time it detects a clap or
tap or short whistle.

The second 10u is charged via the 5k6 and 33k and when a sound is detected,
the negative excursion of the waveform takes the positive end of the 10u
towards the 0v rail. The negative end of the 10u will actually go below 0v
and this will pull the two 1N4148 diodes so the anode ends will have near
to zero volts on them.

As the voltage drops, the transistor in the bi-stable circuit that is turned
on, will have 0.6v on the base while the transistor that is turned off,
will have zero volts on the base. As the anodes of the two signal diode
are brought lower, the transistor that is turned on, will begin to turn off
and the other transistor will begin to turn on via its 100u and 47k. As it
begins to turn on, the transistor that was originally turned on will get
less "turn-on" from its 100u and 47k and thus the two switch over very
quickly. The collector of the third transistor can be taken to a buffer
transistor to operate a relay or other device.

See a [simple Clap Switch using a CD4017 IC in 100 IC Circuits](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/100%20IC%20Circuits/1-100_IC-Ccts.html)

## INTERCOM

Here is a 2-station intercom using common 8R mini speakers.

![Intercom](images/Intercom.png)

The "press-to-talk" switches should have a spring-return so the intercom can
never be left ON. The secret to preventing instability (motor-boating) with a
high gain circuit like this is to power the speaker from a separate power
supply! You can connect an extra station (or two extra stations) to this
design.

Request from Kim Edwards:

> Please analyse this circuit for me. The circuit is not normal as it must
> consume no current when sitting around and either end must be able to call
> the other end.

Start with the first transistor. It is self-biased with about half rail voltage
on the collector. The second transistor is self-biased with about 1v on the
base (via the 220k and 1M). 0.4v across 470R makes about 1v across the 1k
resistor. The emitter of the BC557 will be about 0.4v lower than supply-rail.

This will produce about 1v p-p output via the speaker.

Increasing the 220k to 470k will increase the volume. The 10u to the speaker
allows AC signal to enter the amplifier and the 10u on the supply-rail keeps
the voltage from fluctuating too much as the supply is coming via the speaker.
The 100u improves the current from the battery when the battery is weak.

## WARNING BEACON

![Beacon-12v](images/Beacon-12v.png)

Here is a 12v Warning Beacon suitable for a car or truck
break- down on the side of the road. The key to the operation of the circuit
is the high gain of the Darlington transistors. The circuit must be kept
"tight" (thick wires) to be sure it will oscillate.

A complete kits of parts and PC board costs $5.00 plus postage from Talking
Electronics. Email HERE for details.

Here is the modification for 3-5 super-bright LEDs:

![Beacon-12vLEDs](images/Beacon-12vLEDs.png)

Click HERE for LED Turning Indicator project.

## PHASE-SHIFT OSCILLATOR also called SINEWAVE OSCILLATOR

![PhaseShiftOsc-Ccts](images/PhaseShiftOsc-Ccts.png)

These circuits produces a sinewave very nearly equal to rail voltage.

The important feature is the need for the emitter resistor and 10u /47u
bypass electrolytic. It is a most-important feature of the circuit. It
provides reliable start-up and guaranteed operation. For 6v operation,
the 100k is reduced to 47k.  The three 10n capacitors and two 10k resistors
(actually 3) determine the frequency of operation (700Hz).

The 100k and 10k base-bias resistors can be replaced with 2M2 between base
and collector.

This type of circuit can be designed to operate from about 10Hz to about
200kHz.

Both these circuits are NOT VERY RELIABLE. They work with some transistors
better than others. They stop working when you touch some of the parts. The
frequency changes when you add a 100u across the power rails. They are too
fiddly to be recommended. Place a piezo diaphragm across the collector load and
experiment yourself. Try changing the 1k and try 6v to 12v to see what I mean.

## BLOCKING OSCILLATOR also called FLYBACK OSCILLATOR

![BlockingOscillator](images/BlockingOscillator.png)

The circuit produces high voltage pulses (spikes) of about 40v p-p (when the
LED is not connected), at a frequency of 200kHz. The super-bright LED on the
output absorbs the pulses and uses the energy to produce illumination. The
voltage across the LED will be about 3.6v The winding to the base is connected
so that it turns the transistor ON harder until it is saturated. At this point
the flux cannot increase any more and the transistor starts to turn off. The
collapsing magnetic field in the transformer produces a very high voltage and
that's why we say the transformer operates in FLYBACK mode.

This type of circuit will operate from 10kHz to a few MHz.

## LOW VOLTAGE FLASHER

![LowVoltageFlasher](images/LowVoltageFlasher.png)

This circuit flashes when the voltage drops to 4v.

The voltage "set-point" can be adjusted by changing the 150k on the base of the
first transistor.

## POWER ON

![PowerON](images/PowerON.png)

This LED illuminates for a few seconds when the power is turned on. The circuit
relies on the 47u discharging into the rest of the circuit so that it is
uncharged when the circuit is turned on again.

## CAR LOOP DETECTOR

![CarLoopDetector](images/CarLoopDetector.png)

A 25cm dia coil (consisting of 40 turns and 12 turns) is placed in the centre
of a driveway (between two sheets of plastic). When a vehicle is driven over
the coil, it responds by the waveform collapsing. This occurs because the tank
circuit made up of the 40 turns is receiving just enough feedback signal from
the 12 turns to keep it oscillating. When metal is placed near the coil, it
absorbs some of the electromagnetic waves and the amplitude decreases. This
reduces the amplitude in the 12 turns and the oscillations collapses. The
second transistor turns off and the 10k pulls the base of the third transistor
(an emitter-follower) to the 6v rail and turns on the LED.

## ALARM USING 4-BUTTONS

![Alarm-4Buttons](images/Alarm-4Buttons.png)

To open the lock, buttons S1, S2, S3, and S4 must
be pressed in this order. They must be pressed for more than 0.7 seconds
and less than 1.3 seconds.

Reset button S5 and disable button S6 are also included with the other
buttons and if the disable button is pressed, the circuit will not accept
any code for 60 seconds. Each of the 3v3 zeners can be replaced with two red
LEDs and this will show how you are progressing through the code. Make sure
the LEDs are not visible to other users.

## AUDIO AMPLIFIER (mini)

![AudioAmpmini](images/AudioAmpmini.png)

This project is called "mini" because its size is small and the output is
small.

It uses surface mount technology.

### HOW THE CIRCUIT WORKS

The output is push-pull and consumes less than 3mA
(with no signal) but drives the earpiece to a very loud level when audio
is detected.

The whole circuit is DC coupled and this makes it extremely difficult to
set up.

Basically you don't know where to start with the biasing. The two most
critical components are 8k2 between the emitter of the first transistor and
0v rail and the 470R resistor.

The 8k2 across the 47u sets the emitter voltage on the BC 547 and this
turns it on. The collector is directly connected to the base of a BC 557,
called the driver transistor. Both these transistors are now turned on and
the output of the BC 557 causes current to flow through the 1k and 470R
resistors so that the voltage developed across each resistor turns on the
two output transistors. The end result is mid-rail voltage on the join of
the two emitters.

The 8k2 feedback resistor provides major negative feedback while the 330p
prevents high-frequency oscillations occurring.

## CAPACITOR DISCHARGE UNIT MkII (CDU2)

![CDU 2](images/CDU2_Cct.png)

This project is available as a kit for $10.80 plus $6.50 post; email [Talking
Electronics](mailto:talking@tpg.com.au) for details.

![CDU 2](images/CDU2.png)

This circuit will operate a two-solenoid point-motor and prevent it overheating
and causing any damage. The circuit produces energy to change the points and
ceases to provide any more current. This is carried out by the switching
arrangement within the circuit, by sampling the output voltage.

If you want to control the points with a DPDT toggle switch or slide switch,
you will need two CDU2 units.

### HOW THE CIRCUIT WORKS

![CDU 2-a](images/CDU2-a.png)

The circuit is supplied by 16v AC or DC and the diode
on the input is used to rectify the voltage if AC is supplied. If nothing
is connected to the output, the base of the BD679 is pulled high and the
emitter follows. This is called an emitter-follower stage. The two 1,000u
electrolytics charge and the indicator LED turns on. The circuit is now ready.

![CDU 2-b](images/CDU2-b.png)

When the Main or Siding switch is pressed, the energy from the electrolytics
is passed to the point motor and the points change. As the output voltage
drops, the emitter-follower transistor is turned off and when the switch is
released, the electrolytics start to charge again.  The point-motor can be
operated via a Double-Pole Double-Throw Centre-Off toggle switch, providing
the switch is returned to the centre position after a few seconds so that
the CDU unit can charge-up.

## CAPACITOR DISCHARGE UNIT MkII (CDU2) - modification

![CDU 2-Mods](images/CDU2-Mods.png)

If your ransformer does not supply 15vAC to 16vAC, you can increase the input
voltage by adding a 100u to 220u electrolytic and 1N4004 diode to the input to
create a voltage doubling arrangement. You can also change one or both the
1,000u electrolytics for 2,200u. This will deliver a much larger pulse to the
point-motor and guarantee operation.

## PHONE BUG

![TelephoneBug-3Cct](images/TelephoneBug-3Cct.png)

see also [PHONE TRANSMITTER A] and [PHONE TRANSMITTER B] projects from the
first part.

![TelephoneBug-3](images/TelephoneBug-3.png)

This circuit connects to a normal phone line and when the voltage drops to less
than 15v, the first transistor is turned off and enables the second transistor
to oscillate at approx 100MHz and transmit the phone conversation to a nearby
FM radio. The transistors must be 65v devices. Do not use BC547.

## CODE LOCK

![CodeLock](images/CodeLock.png)

This circuit turns on a relay when the correct code is entered
on the 8-way DIP switches. Two different types of DIP switches are shown.
Keep the top switch off and no current will be drawn by the circuit.

There are 256 different combinations and because the combination is in binary,
it would be very difficult for a burglar to keep up with the settings of
the switches.

## LEDS SHOW RELAY STATE

![LEDsForRelay](images/LEDsForRelay.png)

The green LED indicates the relay is not energised
and the red LED shows the relay is energised.

## VOLTAGE MULTIPLIERS

![VoltageMultipliers](images/VoltageMultipliers.png)

The first circuit takes a square wave (any amplitude) and doubles it - minus
about 2v losses in the diodes and base-emitter of the transistors.

The second circuit must rise to at least 5.6v and fall to nearly 0.4v for the
circuit to work. Also the rise and fall times must be very fast to prevent
both transistors coming on at the same time and short-circuiting.

The third circuit doubles an AC voltage. The AC voltage rises "V" volts
above the 0v rail and "V" volts below the 0v rail.

## VOLTAGE DOUBLER

![VoltageDoubler](images/VoltageDoubler.png)

This is a voltage doubler circuit from a bicycle dynamo design found on the
web. The dynamo produces 6v AC and charges a 3.3FARAD super cap via 2 diodes
and an electrolytic. As you will see, C2, D3 and D4 are not needed and can be
removed.

This is how the circuit works.  The voltage at the mid point of diodes D1 and
D2 can fall to -0.6v and rise to rail voltage plus 0.6v without any current
being supplied from the dynamo.  When the voltage rises more than 0.6v above
rail voltage, the dynamo needs to deliver current and this will allow the rail
voltage to increase. We start with the dynamo producing negative from the left
side and positive on the right side.

The left side will fall to -0.6v below the 0v rail and the right side will
charge C1 and C2 will simply rise in exactly the same manner as we described
the left side of the dynamo being able to rise.

Suppose C1 charges to about 7v (which it will be able to do after a few
cycles). The voltage from the dynamo now reverses and the left side is
positive and the right side is negative. The right side is already sitting
at a potential of 7v (via C1) and as the left side increases, it raises the
rail voltage higher by an amount that could be as high as 7v minus 0.6v.

The actual rail voltage will not be as high as this as the 3.3 Farad capacitor
will be charging, but if energy is not taken from the circuit it will rise
to nearly 14v or even higher according to the peak voltage delivered by
the dynamo.  When the dynamo is delivering energy to the positive rail,
it is "pushing down" on the C1 and some of its stored energy is also
delivered. This means it will have a lower voltage across it when the next
cycle comes around. C2, D3 and D4 are not needed and can be removed. In fact,
C1 will always have rail voltage on it due to the 47 resistor, so the voltage
doubling will start as soon as the dynamo operates.

### DYNAMO VOLTAGE DOUBLER

Here is a simple circuit to increase the voltage
from a BICYCLE DYNAMO (or HAND CRANKED GENERATOR that has a spinning magnet -
NOT a DC motor) and change the AC voltage it produces, to DC, and charge a
small battery:

![BicycleDynamoDoubler](images/BicycleDynamoDoubler.png)

### BATTERY-CHARGER DOUBLER

This circuit will charge a battery from an AC source where the AC voltage is
too low to charge the battery.

![DoublerBattery-Charger](images/DoublerBattery-Charger.png)

This circuit increases the voltage and rectifies it to produce pulsing DC. The
100u electrolytic limits the current and can be increased to 1,000u to provide
a higher current.

Even though the voltage will be increased to about twice the previous voltage,
this will not affect the battery as the important quantity is CURRENT and TIME.
You need to monitor the battery and determine when it is fully charged.

## ADJUSTABLE HIGH CURRENT REGULATED POWER SUPPLY

![5A-AdjustableSupply](images/5A-AdjustableSupply.png)

There are two ways to add a 2N3055 (TIP3055) as the pass transistor for a high
current power supply. This is handy as most hobbyists will have one of these in
their parts box. RL must be low enough to guarantee at least a 30mA. It can be
a separate resistor or part of the actual load.

## INDUCTIVELY COUPLED POWER SUPPLY

![InductivePowerSupply](images/InductivePowerSupply.png)

This circuit is from an Interplak Model PB-12 electric toothbrush.

A coil in the charging base (always plugged in and on) couples to a
mating coil in the hand unit to form a step down transformer. The MPSA44
transistor is used as an oscillator at about 60 kHz which results in much
more efficient energy transfer via the air core coupling than if the system
were run at 50 or 60Hz. The amplitude of the oscillations varies with the
full wave rectified 100Hz or 120Hz unfiltered DC.

The battery charger is nothing more than a diode to rectify the signal from
the 120 turn coil in the charging base. Thus the battery is in constant
trickle charge as long as the hand unit is in the base. The battery pack is
a pair of 600mAhr AA NiCd cells.

## POWERING A LED

![Drive-A-LED](images/Drive_A_LED.png)

Sometimes the output of a gate does not have sufficient current to illuminate a
LED to full brightness.

Here are two circuits. The circuits illuminate the LED when the output signal
is HIGH. Both circuits operate the same and have the same effect on loading the
output of the gate.

## NiCd BATTERY CHARGER

![NiCd-Charger](images/NiCd_Charger.png)

This NiCd battery charger can charge up to 8 NiCd cells connected in series.
This number can be increased if the power supply is increased by 1.65v for each
additional cell. If the BD679 is mounted on a good heatsink, the input voltage
can be increased to a maximum of 25v. The circuit does not discharge the
battery if the charger is disconnected from the power supply.

Usually NiCd cells must be charged at the 14 hour rate. This is a charging
current of 10% of the capacity of the cell for 14 hours. This applies to a
nearly flat cell. For example, a 600 mAh cell is charged at 60mA for 14 hours.
If the charging current is too high it will damage the cell. The level of
charging current is controlled by the 1k pot from 0mA to 600mA. The BC557 is
turned on when NiCd cells are connected with the right polarity. If you cannot
obtain a BD679, replace it with any NPN medium power Darlington transistor
having a minimum voltage of 30v and a current capability of 2A. By lowering the
value of the 1 ohm resistor to 0.5 ohm, the maximum output current can be
increased to 1A.

## CRYSTAL TESTER

This circuit will test crystals from 1MHz to 30MHz.

![XtalTester](images/XtalTester.png)

When the crystal oscillates, the output will pass through the 1n capacitor to
the two diodes. These will charge the 4n7 and turn on the second transistor.
This will cause the LED to illuminate.

## LOW VOLTAGE CUT-OUT

![LowV-cutout](images/LowV-cutout.png)

This circuit will detect when the voltage of a 12v battery reaches a low level.
This is to prevent deep-discharge or maybe to prevent a vehicle battery
becoming discharged to a point where it will not start a vehicle. This circuit
is different to anything previously presented. It has HYSTERESIS. Hysteresis is
a feature where the upper and lower detection-points are separated by a gap.

Normally, the circuit will deactivate the relay when the voltage is 10v and
when the load is removed. The battery voltage will rise slightly by as little
as 50mV and turn the circuit ON again. This is called "Hunting." The off/on
timing has been reduced by adding the 100u. But to prevent this totally from
occurring, a 10R to 47R is placed in the emitter lead. The circuit will turn
off at 10v but will not turn back on until 10.6v when a 33R is in the emitter.
The value of this resistor and the turn-on and turn-off voltages will also
depend on the resistance of the relay.

## THE DARLINGTON TRANSISTOR

Normally a single transistor-stage produces a gain of about 100.

If you require a very high gain, two stages can be used. Two transistors can be
connected connected in many ways and the simplest is DIRECT COUPLING. This is
shown in the circuit below. An even simpler method is to combine two
transistors in one package to form a single transistor with very high gain,
called DARLINGTON TRANSISTOR.

These are available as:

- BD679 NPN-Darlington
- 2N6284 NPN-Darlington
- BC879 NPN-Darlington
- BC880 PNP-Darlington
- TIP122 NPN-Darlington
- TIP127 PNP-Darlington

These devices consist of two NPN or PNP transistors but the same result can be
obtained by using a PNP/NPN pair. This is called a Sziklai pair. This
arrangement will have to be created with two separate transistors.

The Darlington transistor can also be referred to as: "Super Transistor, Super
Alpha Pair, Sziklai pair, Complementary Pair, Darlington transistors have a
gain of 1,000 to 30,000. When the gain is 1,000:1 an input of 1mA will produce
a current of 1 amp in the collector-emitter circuit.  The only disadvantage of
a Darlington Transistor is the minimum voltage between collector-emitter when
fully saturated. It is 0.6v to 1.5v depending on the current through the
transistor.

A normal transistor has a collector-emitter voltage (when saturated) of 0.2v to
0.5v. The higher voltage means the transistor will heat up more and requires
good heatsinking. In addition, a Darlington transistor needs 1.2v between base
and emitter before it will turn on. A Sziklai pair only requires 0.6v for it to
turn on.

![DarlingtonTransistors](images/DarlingtonTransistors.png)

## PIC PROGRAMMER

The simplest programmer to program PIC chips is connected
to your computer via the serial port. This is a 9-pin plug/socket arrangement
called a SUB-D9 with the male plug on the computer and female on a lead that
plugs into the computer.

The signals that normally appear on the pins are primary designed to talk to a
modem but we use the voltages and the voltage-levels to power a programmer. The
voltages on the pins are On or Off. On (binary value "1") means the pin is
between -3 and -25 volts, while Off (binary value "0") means it is between
+3 and +25 volts, depending on the computer. But many serial ports produce
voltages of only +8v and -8V and the programmer circuit uses this to produce
a voltage of about 13.5v to put the PIC chip into programming mode. This
is the minimum voltage for the programmer to work. Any computers with a
lower voltage cannot be used. That's why the circuit looks so unusual. It
is combining voltages to produce 13v5.  Here are two circuits.

The first circuit is used in our [PIC PROGRAMMER - 12 parts project](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Pic%20ProgrammerMkV%2012%20Parts/PicProgrammer-12Parts.html).

Circuit 2 uses more components to produce the same result and circuit 3 uses
less components.

![PicProgrammer12Parts](images/PicProgrammer12Parts.png)

![PicProgrammer-2](images/PicProgrammer-2.png)

![PicProgrammer-3](images/PicProgrammer-3.png)

## FLUORESCENT INVERTER

The simple circuit will drive up to two 20watt fluoro tubes from a 12v supply.

![Fluoro-Inv-a](images/Fluoro_Inv-a.png)

The circuit also has a brightness adjustment to reduce the current from the
battery. See Fluorescent Inverter article for more details.

### 5-WATT CFL DRIVER

![CFL-Driver-2](images/CFL-Driver-2.png)

Both circuits are almost identical and this circuit has the brightness section
removed and the 100u removed. The removal of the 100u reduces the brightness
but it also reduces the current from 500mA to 250mA to make a very efficient
circuit for an emergency situation.

Note: Driving a 20 watt tube (normal 2-foot tube) produces much-more
illumination than a 5 watt CFL.

<!--full-->![DriveCFL-sm](images/DriveCFL-sm.jpg)

This circuit will drive a 5watt CFL tube from an old CFL lamp from 6v or
12v. It makes a very handy emergency light.

The transformer is made by winding 500 turns for the secondary.

This consists of winding about 10 turns on top of each other before advancing
along the rod. The rod can be round or flat, from an old AM radio. It is
called a ferrite rod. The 500 turns have to be added before reaching the end
and this means 100 turns has to take up 1/5th of the distance. This reduces
the voltage between the turns as the enamel will only withstand 100 volts.

Before you start winding, use at least 3 layers of “sticky-tape” to
prevent the high voltage shorting to the rod.

The size of the wire is not important and anything 0.25mm or thinner will
be suitable. After winding the secondary, the primary is 50 turns and the
feedback is 10 turns.

The primary can be 0.5mm wire and the feedback 0.25mm.

Connect the transistor, components and tube and turn the circuit ON very
briefly. If the tube does not illuminate immediately, reverse the wires to
the feedback winding.

The transistor must be 2N 3055 (or the plastic version, TIP 3055). It will
get warm when illuminating the lamp and needs to be heatsinked. The lamp
must not be removed as the circuit will overload and damage the transistor.

The circuit takes 250mA when driving a 5 watt CFL (or 18 watt fluorescent
tube) on 12v supply. The 1k base resistor can be reduced to 820R and the
brightness will increase slightly but the current will increase to 500mA.

The circuit is more-efficient on 6v. The 1k base resistor is reduced to 220R
and the transistor remains cool.

## CFL DRIVER

This circuit will drive a 5watt Compact Fluorescent Lamp from 12v:

![CFL-Driver](images/CFL-Driver.png)

## ZAPPER - 160v

This project will give you a REAL SHOCK.

![Zapper-160v](images/Zapper-160v.png)

It produces up to 160v and outputs this voltage for a very short period of
time. The components are taken from an old CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp) as
the transistors are high voltage types and the 1u5 electro @400v can also be
taken from the CFL as well as the ferrite core for the transformer.

The CFL has a 1.5mH choke with a DC resistance of 4 ohms. This resistance is
too low for our circuit and the wire is removed and the core rewound with 50
turns for the feedback winding and 300 turns of 0.1mm wire to produce a winding
with a resistance of about 10 ohms for the primary.

The oscillator is "flyback" design that produces spikes of about 160v and these
are fed to a high-speed diode (two 1N4148 diodes in series) to charge a 1u5
electrolytic to about 160v. If you put your fingers across the electrolytic you
will hardly feel the voltage. You might get a very tiny tingle at the end of
your fingers.  But if this voltage is delivered, then turned off, you get an
enormous shock and you pull yours fingers off the touch pads.

That's what the other part of the circuit does. It turns on a high-voltage
transistor for a very short period of time and this is what makes the circuit
so effective.

## TELEPHONE AMPLIFIER

This amplifier circuit is used in all home telephones to amplify the signal
from the line to the earpiece.

![Telephone-Amplifier](images/Telephone-Amplifier.png)

The voltage is taken from the line via a bridge that delivers a positive rail,
no matter how the phone wires are connected.

A transformer is used to pick off a signal from the phone line and this is
passed through a 22n to the input of the amplifier. Negative feedback is
provided by a 15k and 1n2 capacitor. The operating point for the amplifier is
set by the 100k pot and this serves to provide an effect on the gain of the
amplifier and thus the volume.

## VHF AERIAL AMPLIFIER

![VHF-Amplifier](images/VHF-Amplifier.png)

This amplifier circuit can be used to amplify VHF
television signals. The gain is between 5dB and 28dB. 300ohm twin feeder
can be used for the In/Out leads.

## CAR LIGHTS ALERT

![CarLightsAlert](images/CarLightsAlert.png)

This circuit will alert the driver if the lights have been left on. A warning
sound will be emitted from the 12v buzzer when the driver's door is opened and
the lights are on.

## HOW A PIEZO BUZZER WORKS

A Piezo Buzzer contains a transistor, coil, and piezo diaphragm and
produces sound when a voltage is applied. The buzzer in the circuit above
is a PIEZO BUZZER.

<!--full-->![PiezoBuzzer](images/PiezoBuzzer.jpg)

![PiezoBuzzer](images/PiezoBuzzer.png)

The circuit starts by the base receiving a small current from the 220k
resistor. This produces a small magnetic flux in the inductor and after a
very short period of time the current does not increase. This causes the
magnetic flux to collapse and produce a voltage in the opposite direction
that is higher than the applied voltage.

3 wires are soldered to pieces of metal on the top and bottom sides of a
ceramic substrate that expands sideways when it sees a voltage. The voltage on
the top surface is passed to the small electrode and this positive voltage is
passed to the base to turn the transistor ON again. This time it is turned ON
more and eventually the transistor is fully turned ON and the current through
the inductor is not an INCREASING CURRENT by a STATIONARY CURRENT and once
again the magnetic flux collapses and produces a very high voltage in the
opposite direction. This voltage is passed to the piezo diaphragm and causes
the electrode to "Dish" and produce the characteristic sound. At the same time
a small amount is "picked-off" and sent to the transistor to create the next
cycle.

## MAINS DETECTOR

![MainsDetector](images/MainsDetector.png)

This circuit detects the "Active" wire of 110v AC or 240v AC
via a probe and does not require "continuity." This makes it a safe detector.
It uses the capacitance of your body to create current flow in the detecting
part of the circuit and the sensitivity will depend on how you hold the
insulating case of the project. No components of the circuit must be exposed
as this will result in ELECTROCUTION.

## SIMPLEST FM BUG

This circuit is the simplest FM circuit you can get.

![SimplestBugCct](images/SimplestBugCct.png)

<!--full-->![SimpleBug-front](images/SimpleBug-front.jpg)

It has no microphone but the coil is so MICROPHONIC that it will pick up noises
in the room via vibrations on a table.

The circuit does not have any section that determines the frequency. In
the next circuit and all those that follow, the section that determines
the frequency of operation is called the TUNED CIRCUIT or TANK CIRCUIT and
consists of a coil and capacitor. This circuit does not have this feature. The
transistor turns on via the 47k and this puts a pulse through the 15 turn
winding. The magnetic flux from this winding passes through the 6 turn
winding and into the base of the transistor via the 22n capacitor. This
pulse is amplified by the transistor and the circuit is kept active.

The frequency is determined by the 6 turn coil. By moving the turns together,
the frequency will decrease. The circuit transmits at 90MHz. It has a very poor
range and consumes 16mA. The coil is wound on a 3mm drill and uses 0.5mm wire.

## A GOOD ONE-TRANSISTOR CIRCUIT

![1TrBug-a](images/1TrBug-a.png)

This circuit uses a TUNED CIRCUIT or TANK CIRCUIT to create the operating
frequency. For best performance the circuit should be built on a PC board with
all components fitted close to each other.


<!--full-->The photo below shows the components on a PC board:
<!--full-->
<!--full-->![1Tr-FMbug](images/1Tr-FMbug.jpg)

### AN IMPROVED DESIGN

![1TrBugwithSlug](images/1TrBugwithSlug.png)

This design uses a "slug tuned coil" to set the frequency. This means the slug
can be screwed in and out of the coil. This type of circuit does not offer any
improvement in stability over the previous circuit. (In later circuits we will
show how to improve stability. The main way to improve stability is to add a
"buffer" stage. This separates the oscillator stage from the output.)

The antenna is connected to the collector of the transistor and this "loads"
the circuit and will cause drift if the bug is touched. The range of this
circuit is about 200 metres and current consumption is about 7mA. The
microphone has been separated from the oscillator and this allows the gain
of the microphone to be set via the 22k resistor. Lowering the resistor
will make the microphone more sensitive. This circuit is the best you can
get with one transistor.

### MORE STABILITY

![1TrBugTappedCoil](images/1TrBugTappedCoil.png)

If you want more stability, the antenna can be tapped
off the top of the tank circuit. This actually does two things. It keeps
the antenna away from the highly active collector and turns the coil into
an auto-transformer where the energy from the 8 turns is passed to a single
turn. This effectively increases the current into the antenna. And that is
exactly what we want.

The range is not as far but the stability is better. The frequency will not
drift as much when the bug is held. As the tap is taken towards the collector,
the output increase but the stability deceases.

## 2-TRANSISTOR CIRCUIT

The next progressive step is to add a transistor
to give the electret microphone more sensitivity. The electret microphone
contains a Field Effect Transistor and you can consider it to be a stage of
amplification. That's why the electret microphone has a very good output.

A further stage of amplification will give the bug extremely good
sensitivity and you will be able to pick up the sound of a pin dropping on
a wooden floor.

Many of the 1 transistor circuits over-drive the microphone and this will
create a noise like bacon and eggs frying. The microphone's used by Talking
Electronics require a load resistor of 47k for a 6v supply and 22k for
a 3v supply. The voltage across the microphone is about 300mV to 600mV.
Only a very simple self-biasing common-emitter stage is needed. This will
give a gain of approx 70 for a 3v supply. The circuit below shows this audio
amplifier, added to the previous transmitter circuit. This circuit is the
best design using 2 transistors on a 3v supply. The circuit takes about 7mA
and produces a range of about 200 - 400metres.

![2-TrFMTx](images/2-TrFMTx.png)

Five points to note in the circuit above:

1. The tank circuit has a fixed 39p and is adjusted by a 2-10p trimmer. The
   coil is stretched to get the desired position on the band and the trimmer
fine tunes the location.
2. The microphone coupling is a 22n ceramic. This value is sufficient as its
   capacitive reactance at 3-4kHz is about 4k and the input to the audio stage
is fairly high, as noted by the 1M on the base.
3. The 1u between the audio stage and oscillator is needed as the base has a
   lower impedance as noted by the 47k base-bias resistor.
4. The 22n across the power rails is needed to keep the rails "tight." Its
   impedance at 100MHz is much less than one ohm and it improves the
performance of the oscillator enormously.
5. The coil in the tank circuit is 5 turns of enameled wire with air core. The
   secret to long range is high activity in the oscillator stage.  The tank
circuit (made up of the coil and capacitors across it) will produce a voltage
higher than the supply voltage due to the effect known as "collapsing magnetic
field" and this occurs when the coil collapses and passes its reverse voltage
to the capacitor. The antenna is also connected to this point and it receives
this high waveform and passes the energy to the atmosphere as electromagnetic
radiation.

When the circuit is tightly constructed on a PC board, the frequency will
not drift very much if the antenna is touched.

## THE VOYAGER

The only way to get a higher output from two transistors is to increase the
supply voltage.

![Voyager-Cct](images/Voyager-Cct-bw.png)

The following circuit is available from Talking Electronics as a surface-mount
kit, with some components through-hole. The project is called
[THE VOYAGER](www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Voyager/Voyager-P1.html).

All the elements of good design have been achieved in this project. The
circuit has a slightly higher output than the 3v circuit above, but most of
the voltage is lost across the emitter resistor and not converted to RF. The
main advantage of this design is being able to connect to a 9v battery. In
a technical sense, about half the energy is wasted as the stages actually
require about 4v - 5v for maximum output.

<!--full-->![PC-on-battery11](images/PC-on-battery11.jpg)

## HAND-HELD MICROPHONE

![2-TrWithBufferOP](images/2-TrWithBufferOP.png)

This circuit is suitable for a hand-held microphone.

It does not have an audio stage but that makes it ideal as a microphone, to
prevent feedback. The output has a buffer stage to keep the oscillator away
from the antenna. This gives the project the greatest amount of stability
-rather than the highest sensitivity.

### INCREASING THE RANGE

![FMCct-2](images/FMCct-2.png)

To increase the range, the output must be
increased. This can be done by using an RF transistor and adding an
inductor. This effectively converts more of the current taken by the circuit
(from the battery) into RF output. The output is classified as an untuned
circuit. A BC547 transistor is not suitable in this location as it does
not amplify successfully at 100MHz. It is best to use an RF transistor such
as 2N3563.

### MORE RANGE

More output can be obtained by increasing the supply voltage and adding a
capacitor across the inductor in the output stage to create a tuned output.

![FMCct-3](images/FMCct-3.png)

**A tuned output stage delivers more output.**

The 5-30p must be adjusted each time the frequency of the bug is changed. This
is best done with a field strength meter. See [Talking Electronics Field
Strength Meter](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/FieldStrengthMeterMkll/FieldStrengthII.html)
 project.

The 2N3563 is capable of passing 15mA in the buffer stage and about 30% is
delivered as RF. This makes the transmitter capable of delivering about 22mW.

## EMITTER TAP

The following circuit taps the emitter of the oscillator
stage.

![FMCct-7](images/FMCct-7.png)

The collector or the emitter can be tapped to produce about the same
results, however tapping the emitter "loads" the oscillator less. The 47p
capacitor is adjusted to "pick-off" the desired amount of energy from the
oscillator stage. It can be reduced to 22p or 10p.

Tapping the emitter of the oscillator transistor

### GOING FURTHER

The next stage to improve the output, matches the impedance
of the output stage to the impedance of the antenna.

![AntTransfCct](images/AntTransfCct.png)

The impedance of the output stage is about 1k to 5k, and the impedance of
the antenna is about 50 ohms.

This creates an enormous matching problem but one effective way is with an
RF transformer.

![AntTransformer](images/AntTransformer.jpg)

An RF transformer is simply a transformer that operates at high frequency. It
can be air cored or ferrite cored. The type of ferrite needed for 100MHz
is F28. The circuit above uses a small ferrite slug 2.6mm dia x 6mm long,
F28 material.

To create an output transformer for the circuit above, wind 11 turns
onto the slug and 4 turns over the 11 turns. The ferrite core will do two
things. Firstly it will pass a high amount of energy from the primary winding
to the antenna and secondly it will

THE **RF TRANSFORMER**  prevent harmonics passing to the antenna.  The
transformer approximately doubles the output power of the transmitter.

## WATER LEVEL DETECTOR

This circuit can be used to automatically keep the header tank filled. It uses
a double-pole relay.

![WaterLevelDetector-3](images/WaterLevelDetector-3.png)

### CIRCUIT 2

The circuit below is the simplest design and consumes almost
zero current when the tank is full. When the water is LOW, the circuit is
turned ON via the 100k pot and 10k resistor.

![WaterLevelDetector-4](images/WaterLevelDetector-4.png)

When the water reaches the copper wire, the voltage on the base of the first
transistor reduces and the current into the Darlington arrangement is too
small to keep the relay energised and the motor turns OFF.

As the water-level drops, the current into the Darlington pair increases
and a point is reached when the relay pulls-in again.

### CIRCUIT 3

This simple circuit will show the water level in a tank.

![WaterLevelDetector-4](images/WaterLevelDetector-4.png)

It has a HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW levels and as the water touches the pads,
the LEDs start to illuminate. This produces a range of levels to let you
know exactly the level of the water.

The sensor pads can be cut from a tin-can or you can use the lid of a tin.

The main sensor is placed at the bottom of the water so the low-level LED
will let you know the tank is almost empty.  The circuit has been drawn to
show the transistors are placed on the top of the tank with wires going to
each of the sensor pads. The LEDs and resistors are mounted on a wall in
your house with the 3v supply and a push-switch.  You will need a 4-wire
connection between the two units and this can be 4-core telephone cable.

The transistors are wired as emitter-followers and this saves 4 resistors
(base-bias resistors). It also allows the LEDs to come on slowly as the
water rises so you get a wide indication of the water level.  You can add
more sensors if required. Simply repeat the circuit above for 3 more levels.

Any NPN transistor can be used and any value resistor between 100 ohms and
330 ohms can be used and the voltage can be increased to 6v if you are using
a high-value resistor.

The circuit only takes current when the switch is pressed but it can be left
ON all the time to let you know the water level, if needed.

You don’t need a circuit board. Simply hammer a few nails into a length of
wood to hold the sensors and connect the transistors to the nails by soldering.

Make sure the sensor pads are away form the wood and don’t hold any water
when the level goes down as the circuit is so sensitive that the LEDs will
not go out.

## BATTERY CHARGER - world's simplest automatic charger

This is the world's simplest automatic battery charger.

![AutoBatteryCharger-1](images/AutoBatteryCharger-1.png)

It consists of 6 components, when connected to a 12v DC plug pack. The
plug pack must produce more than 15v on no-load (which most plug packs
do.) An alternative 15v transformer and a centre-tapped transformer is also
shown. A centre-tapped transformer is referred to as: 15v-CT-15v or 15-0-15
The relay and transistor are not critical as the 1k pot is adjusted so the
relay drops-out at 13.7v.

To improve the "pull-in" and "drop-out" voltages, the 10k can be replaced with
a 12v zener. The zener can be made up of two 6v zeners or any combination in
series and include ordinary diodes (drop 0.6v).

The plug pack can be 300mA, 500mA or 1A and its current rating will depend
on the size of the 12v battery you are charging.

For a 1.2AH gel cell, the charging current should be 100mA. However, this
charger is designed to keep the battery topped-up and it will deliver current
in such short bursts, that the charging current is not important.

This applies if you are keeping the battery connected while it is being
used. In this case the charger will add to the output and deliver some
current to the load while charging the battery. If you are charging a flat
cell (flat 12v battery - a discharged 12v battery), the current should not
be more than 100mA.

For a 7AH battery, the current can be 500mA. And for a larger battery,
the current can be 1Amp.

Most 12v Plug Packs produce 15v to 16v on NO-LOAD and we are using this
feature to charge the battery. We are also using the poor regulation of the
plug pack to charge the battery without the plug pack overheating.

### SETTING UP

Connect the charger to a battery and place a digital meter across the battery.
Adjust the 1k pot so the relay drops out as soon as the voltage rises to 13.7v.

Place a 100R 2watt resistor across the battery and watch the voltage drop.

The charger should turn on when the voltage drops to about 12.5v. This voltage
is not extremely critical. It happens to be the "hysteresis" of the circuit
and is determined by the value of the load in the collector of the transistor.

The 22u stops the relay "squealing" or "hunting" when a load is connected to
the battery and the charger is charging. As the battery voltage rises, the
charging current reduces and just before the relay drops out, it squeals as
the voltage rises and falls due to the action of the relay. The 22u prevents
this "chattering".

To increase the Hysteresis: In other words, decrease the voltage where the
circuit cuts-in, add a 270R across the coil of the relay. This will increase
the current required by the transistor to activate the relay and thus increase
the gap between the two activation points. The pull-in point on the pot will
be higher and you will have re-adjust the pot, but the drop-out point will
be the same and thus the gap will be wider.

In our circuit, the cut-in voltage was 11.5v with a 270R across the relay.

Note: No diode is needed across the relay because the transistor is never
fully turned off and no back EMF (spike) is produced by the relay.

## AUTOMATIC BATTERY CHARGER

![AutoBatteryCharger-2](images/AutoBatteryCharger-2.png)

- trickle charger.

This circuit will automatically keep a battery fully charged with the
charge-current reducing when the battery voltage reaches 13.8v. The battery can
be used at any time and the charger will maintain full charge.

The transistor acts like a POWER ZENER (with the 13.8v zener on the base) and
the supply rail does not rise above 13.8v + 0.6v = 14.4v. The 1N4004 removes
the 0.6v to deliver 13.8v to the battery.

If the plug pack is replaced with a supply capable of delivering a voltage
higher than 16v (on no-load), the 3R3 (3watt) resistor will be needed. The
transistor simply removes the charging current from the battery and wastes it
as heat.

## BATTERY CHARGER MkII

![BatteryChargerMkII](images/BatteryChargerMkII.png)

 - a very simple design to keep a battery "topped up."

This is a very simple battery charger to keep a battery "nearly fully charged."
It consists of 7 components, when connected to a 12v - 18v DC plug pack. The
plug pack must produce more than 15v on no-load (which most 12v plug packs do.)
For a 1.2AH gel cell, up to a 45Ahr car or boat battery, this charger will keep
the battery topped-up and can be connected for many months as the battery will
not lose water due to "gassing."

The output voltage is 13.2v and this is just enough to keep the battery from
discharging, but will take a very long time to charge a battery, if it is
flat because a battery produces a "floating charge" of about 13.6v when it
is being charged (at a reasonable current) and this charger is only designed
to deliver a very small current.

There is a slight difference between a "old-fashioned" car battery (commonly
called "an accumulator") and a sealed battery called a Gel Cell. The
composition of the plates of a gel cell is such that the battery does not
begin to "gas" until a high voltage is reached. That is why it can be totally
closed and only has rubber bungs that "pop" if gas at high pressure develops
due to gross over-charging. That's why the charging voltage must not be too
high and when the battery is fully charged, the charging current must drop
to a very low level.

## GELL CELL BATTERY CHARGER

This circuit will charge gell cell batteries at 300mA or 650mA or 1.3A,
depending on the CURRENT SENSING resistor in the 0v rail. Adjust the 5k pot for
13.4v out and when the battery voltage reaches this level, the current will
drop to a few milliamps. The plug pack will need to be upgraded for the 650mA
or 1.3A charge-current. The red LED indicates charging and as the battery
voltage rises, the current-flow decreases. The maximum is shown below and when
it drops about 5%, the LED turns off and the current gradually drops to almost
zero.

![GellCellCharger](images/GellCellCharger.png)

## TRANSISTOR TESTER COMBO 2

This circuit uses an IC but it has been placed in this eBook as it is a
transistor tester.

![Combo-2](images/Combo-2.png)

The circuit uses a single IC to perform 3 tests:

1. Place the transistor in any orientation into the three terminals of circuit
   1 (below, left) and a red LED will detect the base of a PNP transistor an a
green LED will indicate the base of an NPN transistor.
2. You now now the base lead and the type of transistor. Place the transistor
   in Test 2 circuit (top circuit) and when you have fitted the collector and
emitter leads correctly (maybe have to swap leads), the red or green LED will
come on to prove you have fitted the transistor correctly.
3. The transistor can now be fitted in the GAIN SECTION. Select PNP or NPN and
   turn the pot until the LED illuminates. The value of gain is marked on the
PCB that comes with the kit.  The kit has easy clips that clip onto the leads of
the transistor to make it easy to use the project.  The project also has a
probe at one end of the board that produces a square wave - suitable for all
sorts of audio testing and some digital testing.

Project cost: $22.00 from Talking Electronics.

## LOW MAINS DROPOUT

![LowMainsDropout](images/LowMainsDropout.png)

This circuit will turn off a device if the main drops
by a say 15v. The actual voltage is adjustable. The first thing to remember
is this: The circuit detects the PEAK voltage and this is the voltage of
the zener diodes.

For 240v mains, the peak is 338v.

For a voltage drop of about 12v(RMS), the zener diodes need to have a
combined voltage of 320v (you will need 6 x 47v + 1 x 20v + 1 x 18v). The
10k resistor will have about 18v across it and the current will be nearly
2mA. The wattage will be 36mW.  For a voltage drop of about 27v(RMS), you
will need zeners for a total of 300v by using 6 x 47v + 1 x 18v. The voltage
across the 10k resistor will be 38v and the current will be nearly 4mA. The
wattage dissipated by the 10k resistor will be 150mW.

The 10u prevents very sharp dips or drops from activating the circuit.

As the voltage drops, this drop in voltage will be passed directly to the
top of the 10k resistor and as the voltage drops, the current into the base
of the transistor will reduce. This current is amplified by the transistor
and when it is not sufficient to keep the relay activated, it will drop-out.

## PROTECTING THE CONTACTS OF A RELAY

The contacts of a relay can be protected from the damaging effects of reversing
an actuator.

![Protecting-A-Relay](images/Protecting-A-Relay.png)

The circuit shows a double-pole double-throw relay driving an actuator. The 4
"bridge diodes" around the actuator "squelch" the back-emf from damaging the
contacts.

## REDUCING RELAY CHATTER

![RelayChatter](images/RelayChatter.png)

To reduce the relay clicking or chattering during the activation of the relay
driver transistor, an electrolytic can be placed between the base and 0v rail.
In addition an electro can be placed across the relay if there is a possibility
of the supply voltage glitching or temporally failing.


## 4 TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER.

![4TrAmp](images/4TrAmp.png)

This circuit is fully documented in [The Transistor Amplifier](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/TheTransistorAmplifier/TheTransistorAmplifier.html) as Fig 105.

## VIBRATING VU INDICATOR

This circuit can be used to monitor the output of a
stereo to warn when the level is too high.

![VibratingVU](images/VibratingVU.png)

The output is a pager motor and
will vibrate so you don't have to keep watching VU levels. The first two
transistors are connected so an overload in either channel will trigger the
pager motor. No power switch is needed as all transistors are turned OFF
when no audio is being detected.

## VOX

These circuits detect audio and operate a relay or produce an output
pulse. See full details in: [The Transistor Amplifier eBook](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/TheTransistorAmplifier/TheTransistorAmplifier-P2.html#VOX) - under VOX

## OP-AMP WITH 3 TRANSISTORS

This circuit shows how a simple operational amplifier can be made with 3
transistors.

![Op-amp-withTransistors](images/Op-amp-withTransistors.png)

It is really an AC-coupled single-ended class A amp,
with an open-loop gain of about 5,000, but as a demonstration-circuit, you can
treat it as a simple op-amp. The output is biased at approximately one-half
the supply voltage using the combined voltage drops across the two LEDs,
the emitter-base voltage of the input transistor and the 1v drop across 1M
feedback resistor. The 68k and 4n7 form a compensation network that prevents
the circuit from oscillating.

You can configure this op amp as an active filter or as an oscillator. It
drives a load of 1k. The square-wave response is good at 10kHz, and the
output reduces by 3dB at 50kHz.

## CAPACITOR TESTER

Circuit designed by: Charles Wenzel charles@wenzel.com

![CapacitorTester](images/CapacitorTester.png)

This circuit will test very small capacitors. The tone from the speaker will
change when a capacitor is placed across the test-points "Cx."

The operation of the circuit is explained in our eBook: [The Transistor
Amplifier](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/TheTransistorAmplifier/TheTransistorAmplifier-P1.html#High%20Impedance) (high impedance circuit).

## HIGN BRIGHT LED - EMERGENCY LIGHT

![BatteryBackup-2](images/BatteryBackup-2.png)

This circuit will illuminate two 1watt
High-bright LEDs when the power fails. The charging current is about
20-30mA. It will take about 7 days to charge the battery and this will allow
illumination for 5 hours, once per week.

A charging current more than 50mA will gradually "dry-out" the battery and
shorten its life.

If the project is used more than 5 hours per week, the charging current can
be increased.

The 220R charging resistor can be reduced to 150R or 100R (1watt).

## RELAY OFF DELAY

![RelayOffDelay](images/RelayOffDelay.png)

This circuit turns ON a relay when the input is above 2v
and the relay turns OFF after 2 seconds when the signal is removed. The OFF
delay can be increased or decreased.

## AMPLIFYING A DIGITAL SIGNAL

![AmplifyDigitalSig](images/AmplifyDigitalSig.png)

A Digital signal is only detected as a HIGH or LOW. However if the digital
signal does not have sufficient amplitude, it may not be detected AT ALL.
This circuit detects a low amplitude signal and produces a high-amplitude
signal.

## PIR DETECTOR (see also LED Strip Passage Light)

![PIR-Detector](images/PIR-Detector.png)

This circuit detects movement and operates a relay. The PIR module has
"Sensitivity" and "Time Delay" pots. They can be purchased on eBay for $2.71
including postage!

## DELAY before Turn On then turns OFF

![DelayTurnON](images/DelayTurnON.png)

This circuit turns ON the relay 4 seconds after the power is applied and then
turns it OFF after 2 seconds.

This is a request from a reader.

You will need to change the component values to suit your own timing.

## 10 SECOND DELAY

This clever circuit turns on the LED 10 seconds after the power has been
switched ON. The secret to its performance is the gain of the transistor.

![10SecondDelay](images/10SecondDelay.png)

With a gain of 200, the transistor will appear as a 470/200 = 2k3 resistor
for the LED and for a 12v supply, this will create a current of 12-1.7 /
2300 = 4.4mA through the LED.  The 100u will take about 10 seconds to charge
to a point where the base is 1.7v + 0.6v = 2.3v above the 0v rail. When the
electro charges to this voltage, the LED starts to come on.

The transistor effectively becomes a 2k3 resistor and that's why no additional
current-limiting resistor for the LED is needed. The transistor is the
current-limiting device!

## FERRET FINDER

![FerretFinder](images/FerretFinder.png)

This circuit produces a beep-beep-beep at approx 190kHz
on a Long Wave Band radio.

The transformer (coil) is wound on 10mm dia ferrite rod 10mm long. The
secondary winding is 0.25mm wire. The 135t is 0.01mm wire.  The PC board is
16mm x 14mm.

The secret to the circuit working is the "transformer." The ferrite must
be very short so the flux produced by the circuit saturates the core and
the excess is passed to the surroundings.  A kit for the Ferret Finder is
available from talking electronics for $5.00 plus postage.

## FLASHING LIGHTS FOR MODEL RAILWAY CROSSING

![FlashingCrossing](images/FlashingCrossing.png)

A flashing LED is used to create the timing for the flash-rate and the
transistor provides the alternate flash for the second set of LEDs.

## FADE-ON FADE-OFF LED

The LEDs in is circuit fade on when the power is applied and
fade-off when switched off:

![UpDownFadingLED-2](images/UpDownFadingLED-2.png)

If you just want fade-ON and fade-OFF, this circuit is all you need. The
Darlington transistor has internal resistors between the base and emitter of
each transistor and these will reduce the input impedance of the transistor
considerably. That's why you may have to use fairly low-value resistors on the
delay section. Using two separate (normal) transistors will allow the
resistor-values to be 100k.

You can also drive "rope lights."

These can be surface-mount LEDs or totally-sealed LEDs and generally have
two wires connected to one end for the 12v supply.

Three LEDs are generally connected in series inside the "rope" with a dropper
resistor and some "ropes" can be cut after each set of three LEDs as shown in
the diagram below:

![UpDownFadingLED-3](images/UpDownFadingLED-3.png)

Each set of three LEDs draws about 20mA so a rope of 24 LEDs
takes about 160mA. Adjust the first two 100k resistors and 100u to set the
fade-IN and fade-OUT feature.

## 3-SECOND DELAY

![3-secDelay](images/3-secDelay.png)

When this circuit is connected to a supply (from 3v to
12v), the LED turns on and gradually fades after about 3 seconds.

## REPLACING A "POWER POT"

A Power Potentiometer (also called a rheostat) is a potentiometer with a rating
of 1watt or more and these can be very expensive. A 10watt pot can cost as much
as $25 to $35.

This type of pot can be replaced very cheaply by using an ordinary 500R pot and
a power transistor.

The power pot generally "burns out" when it is at least resistance and this
circuit replaces the pot with one slight exception.

![PowerPot](images/PowerPot.png)

The circuit does not deliver full rail voltage. The output is about 0.9v below
rail voltage. A switch has been included to produce full rail output: 10 watt
POWER POT If the Power Pot is a rheostat, it will have two terminals. One
terminal called "A" will go to rail voltage and the other terminal (the centre
terminal - called the wiper) we will call "B," will go to the load.

<!--full-->![PowerPot](images/PowerPot.jpg)

Build the circuit above and take A and B to the same points as before and
"G" goes to Ground or "earth" or "Chassis."

## CHANGING 24v to 12v

This circuit allows to you charge a 24v project from a 12v charger. It converts
the two 12v batteries from series to parallel:

![12v-24v](images/12v-24v.png)

## ZENER DIODE TESTER

All diodes are Zener diodes. For instance a 1N4148 is
a 120v zener diode as this is its reverse breakdown voltage.

And a zener diode can be used as an ordinary diode in a circuit with a
voltage that is below the zener value.

For instance, 20v zener diodes can be used in a 12v power supply as the
voltage never reaches 20v, and the zener characteristic is never reached.

Most diodes have a reverse breakdown voltage above 100v, while most zeners
are below 70v. A 24v zener can be created by using two 12v zeners in series
and a normal diode has a characteristic voltage of 0.7v. This can be used to
increase the voltage of a zener diode by 0.7v.  To tests a zener diode you
need a power supply about 10v higher than the zener of the diode. Connect
the zener across the supply with a 1k to 4k7 resistor and measure the voltage
across the diode. If it measures less than 1v, reverse the zener.

If the reading is high or low in both directions, the zener is damaged.

Here is a zener diode tester. The circuit will test up to 56v zeners.

![ZenerTesterCct](images/ZenerTesterCct.png)

## LED FADER

![LEDfader](images/LEDfader.png)

This circuit was requested by a theatrical group to slowly
change the colour of a set of LEDs over a period of 1-2 seconds.

## POINT MOTOR DRIVER

One of the first things (you will want) when expanding a model railway is a
second loop or siding.

This needs a set of points and if they are distant from the operator, they
will have to be electrically operated. There are a number of controllers on
the market to change the points and some of them take a very high current. (You
can get a low-current Point Motor).

The high current is needed because the actuating mechanism is very inefficient,
but it must be applied for a very short period of time to prevent the point
motor getting too hot.

Sometimes a normal switch is used to change the points and if the operator
forgets use it correctly, the Point Motor will "burn-out" after a few seconds.

To prevent this from happening we have designed the following circuit. It
operates the Point Motor for 5mS to 10mS (a very short time) and prevents
any damage.

You can use a Peco switch (PL23 - about $10.00!!) or an ordinary toggle
switch (change-over switch).

You can connect to either side of the Point Motor and both contacts of the
other side go to 14v to 22v rail.

<!--full-->![PointMotorSchm](images/PointMotor-Schm.png)
<!--lite-->![PointMotorSchm](images/PointMotor-2.png)

![PointMotorDriver-1](images/PointMotorDriver-1.png)

Point Motor mounted under the track.  The Point-Motor shaft moves left-right
to change the points.

## COIN COUNTER

![CoinCounter](images/CoinCounter.png)

This circuit was designed for a reader who wanted to change
his amusement machine from 3 coins to 4 coins.

The circuit can be modified to "divide-by" any value from 2 to 10:

## HEADLIGHT EXTENDER

This circuit extends the "ON TIME" for headlights and
the circuit does not take any current when the time has expired.  When the
headlights are switched OFF, the circuit keeps the lights ON for 30 seconds.

![HeadlightExtender-Ccts](images/HeadlightExtender-Ccts.png)

The electronics needs 3 connections. The diagram above shows these
connections. The first connection is to the 12v side of the battery. The output
of the circuit is the emitter of the BD679 transistor and this connects to
the relay where the wire from the headlight switch is connected. Finally the
circuit connects to the chassis of the car.  The "delay-time" is determined
by the 100u and 100k resistor. The resistor can be increased to 470k and
the capacitor can be increased to 470u. For an adjustable time-delay, use
a 500k mini trim pot for the 100k resistor.

## TURN INDICATOR ALARM

Many turn indicators in cars, motor bikes and golf
carts are not very loud.

That's why they get left ON.

Here are 2 circuits for you to experiment with and work out which is the best
for your application.  They all use a piezo buzzer that has an oscillator
circuit inside the case and produces a 3kHz annoying tone. We have listed
two different types. TypeA produces a constant 3kHz tone that increases with
loudness as the voltage increases.

TypeB is called a REVERSING BUZZER and produces a beep-beep-beep when
a constant DC voltage is applied. The output increases in volume as the
voltage increases.

Circuit A turns on after 15 seconds to let you know the turn indicator
is active.

You can use Piezo TypeA to get a beep when the turn light is ON and silence
when the light is OFF.

Piezo typeB will produce a beep-beep-beep when the light is ON and silence
when it is OFF.

![TurnAlarm-1](images/TurnAlarm-1.png)

Beeps after 15 seconds.

Circuit B turns on after 15 seconds and the piezo will increase in loudness.

![TurnAlarm-2](images/TurnAlarm-2.png)

Beeps after 15 seconds with increasing volume

A piezo buzzer requires about 15mA and operates from 3v to 12v. Reversing
buzzers are available from Talking Electronics for $4.50 each. They are also
available on the web for $20.00

## SUPPLY VOLTAGE MONITOR

These circuits will monitor supply voltages of ±5v and ±12v. They are not
intended to indicate the level of the inputs. The LED will only illuminate when
all the voltages are present.

![SupplyVoltageMonitor](images/SupplyVoltageMonitor.png)

## SOLAR CHARGER

![Solar-Charger](images/Solar-Charger.png)

This is a simple circuit to keep a set of NiCads fully
charged via a solar panel.

The mathematics and the circuit is the same for a 6v or 12v solar panel.

The mathematics revolves around CURRENT and not VOLTAGE.  Remember: NiCad
cells are 1.2v and you will need 5 cells to produce a 6v supply.

Ni-MH cells are 1.2v and come in 1,700mA-hr and 3,000mA-hr (and other
capacities).

You can recharge ordinary alkaline cells (1.5v) about 50 times. It has about
the same capacity as NiCad after the second re-charge.

1. MEASURE THE CURRENT TAKEN BY THE PROJECT
   Firstly measure the current taken by the project. If it is a constant 10mA,
you will need to charge the batteries with 40mA from the solar panel, if we
assume the sun shines for 8 hours per day.
   
   If the circuit takes 1amp for 1 hour, we need to charge the batteries with
150mA for 8 hours of sunshine.
   
   If the circuit takes 500mA for 15 minutes each hour, this is equivalent to a
constant 125mA and the charging will have to be 500mA for 8 hours each day.
(Even though this is equal to 3Ahr per day, the charging occupies 8 hours and
thus the storage only needs to be 2Ahr and 2400mA-hr cells can be used).

  Our mathematics takes into account 80% efficiency in charging the cells.

  If the NiCad cells are 600mA-hr, the maximum charging current is 100mA.

  If the cells are 2,400mA-hr, the maximum charging current is 500mA.

  This charging current takes into account the fact that the cells will be
fully charged towards the end of each day and that's why the current should
not be too high.

2. MEASURE THE CHARGING CURRENT
   Build one of the circuits below and use a 100 ohm (1 watt) resistor for the
current-limiting.
   Connect a multimeter (select 0 - 500mA or 0 - 2Amp range) as shown and measure
the current during the day. Take a few readings and work out and average
current and approx the length of each day.  Every solar panel will deliver
a different current and it is not possible to specify any values. That's
why you have to take readings. If the current is too high, add another 100
ohm resistor in series. If the current is too low, place a 100 ohm resistor
across the first 100 ohm resistor.

## WHITE NOISE GENERATOR

![WhiteNoise](images/WhiteNoise.png)

The basis of a white noise generator is the reverse
connection of the base-emitter junction of a transistor as shown in fig A.
When the junction sees a voltage above about 5v, it breaks down and this
causes the voltage to reduce. The junction ceases to break down and the
condition repeats. The result is a waveform of a few millivolts to over 2v,
depending on the value of the resistor supplying current to the junction.
This noise sounds like "ssssssssss" and can be added to an amplifier to
produce all sorts of sound effects including Steam Sound for a model railway.
The waveform contains all amplitudes and frequencies from audible up to AM
broadcast band.

Try the following circuits and see how they work. The supply must be over
5v and preferably more than 8v. That's why many of the circuits specify 12v
and higher.

## INTERCOM or TELEPHONE HANDSET

You can make your own intercom or replace
circuitry in old-style handsets with either of these circuits.

Telephone amplifier circuits are completely different to normal amplifier
circuits.  For a start, they have very high negative feedback to prevent
"whistle" and in telephone-speak the circuit is designed so sounds from
the earpiece (receiver) are not picked up by the mouthpiece (microphone)
and amplified to crate a whistle.

Secondly, the load for the amplifier is actually the relay at the exchange
and the signal is picked off at the point where the amplifier connects to
the relay and sent to the other telephone.

This means the supply for both the pre-amplifier and the output stage are
on the same wire as the signal to the other phone.

The voltage across the first circuit is generated by the 150k turning ON the
first BC547 transistor and it "pulls-up" the second transistor (a partial
emitter follower).

This creates current through the 150R and a voltage is developed across this
resistor so that a voltage of approx 15v is developed across the whole circuit.

Here are two circuits for the handset:

## 38KHz INFRARED LINK

![38kHzTx](images/38kHzTx.png)

![38kHzRx](images/38kHzRx.png)

This circuit is an IR transmitter and IR receiver with a 38kHz detector TSOP
1738 in the receiver. This means the circuit will be immune to ambient light.
The motor is activated when the transmitter is turned ON.

## FRIDGE ALARM

![FridgeAlarm-1](images/FridgeAlarm-1.png)

This circuit will start to produce a sound about 15 seconds
after the Light Dependent Resistor detects light:

## FRIDGE ALARM MkII

![FridgeAlarm-2](images/FridgeAlarm-2.png)

This circuit drives an active piezo buzzer and the circuit takes no current
when "sitting around."

It will start to produce a sound about 15 seconds after the Light Dependent
Resistor detects light.  The mini piezo buzzer contains a transistor and
inductor to produce a high amplitude oscillator to drive the diaphragm and
produce a loud squeal from a supply of 3v to 5v. It will not "turn on" from
a slowly rising voltage so the circuit must be designed to rise rapidly when
light is detected. That's the purpose of the 2nd and 3rd transistors. They
form a high-gain amplifier where the output rises quickly due to the positive
feedback provided by the 100n.

As soon as the second transistor starts to turn on, it turns on the 3rd
transistor and the collector voltage rises. The right-plate of the 100n
rises and since the 100n is uncharged, the left plate (lead) rises and
increases the voltage and also the current into the base of the second
transistor. This makes it turn on more and the action continues very quickly
until both transistors are fully turned on. They stay turned on by the voltage
(and current) provided by the first transistor.

Even though we normally see the second two transistors used as an oscillator,
we can use the "rapid turn-on" feature to "kick-start" the piezo and if the
middle transistor is provided with too-much voltage (current) on the base,
the oscillator feature will not occur because the current into the base is
too high and the 100n cannot remove this current during the turn-off period
of the cycle. The only unusual feature of this circuit is the oscillator
section starts to oscillate at very low amplitude when the first transistor
turns off (when the LDR ceases to be illuminated) and a 10u has been added
to stop this oscillation so it takes no current when at rest.

All the other designs (using a chip), take a small current when at rest and
the worst circuit comes from Future Kit, a Thailand based kit company. You
can see the discussion in Spot The Mistake Page 17 under FRIDGE ALARM.

## BATTERY-LOW BEEPER

If you want a simpler circuit using transistors, the
following design will produce a constant beep when the battery voltage falls
below 10v.

The actual voltage can be adjusted by using LEDs and diodes in place of
the zener.

![BatteryLowBeeper-3](images/BatteryLowBeeper-3.png)

The mini piezo buzzer contains a transistor and inductor to produce a high
amplitude oscillator to drive the diaphragm and produce a loud squeal from
a supply of 5v to about 10v. It will not "turn on" from a slowly rising
voltage so the circuit must be designed to rise rapidly when the voltage
drop down to the "detection-point."

That's the purpose of the 3rd and 4th transistors. They form a high-gain
amplifier where the output rises quickly due to the positive feedback provided
by the 100n.

As soon as the third transistor starts to turn on, it turns on the 4th
transistor and the collector voltage rises. The right-plate of the 100n rises
and since the 100n is uncharged, the left plate (lead) rises and increases
the voltage and also the current into the base of the third transistor. This
makes it turn on more and the action continues very quickly until both
transistors are fully turned on. They stay turned on by the voltage (and
current) provided by the first transistor.

Even though we normally see these two transistors used as an oscillator,
we can use the "rapid turn-on" feature to "kick-start" the piezo and if the
third transistor is provided with too-much voltage (current) on the base,
the oscillator feature will not occur because the current into the base is
too high and the 100n cannot remove this current during the turn-off period
of the cycle. The only unusual feature of this circuit is the oscillator
section starts to oscillate at very low amplitude when the second transistor
turns off (when the battery voltage rises) and a 10u has been added to stop
this oscillation so it takes no current when the buzzer is not producing a
tone. The only stages that take any quiescent current are the zener and the
1M collector load resistor.

![BatteryLowBeeper-3_002](images/BatteryLowBeeper-3_002.png)

This circuit will buzz when the voltage drops to a pre-set level.

To adjust the circuit, get as many 10,000u electrolytics as possible and
use them in place of the Li-ion cell.

Charge the electrolytics with the Li-Ion cell and remove it.  The circuit
takes a very amount of current and the voltage across the electrolytics
will gradually drop. Monitor this with a digital meter and set the 100k
pot to the required voltage.

## SOLAR TRACKER

![SolarTracker-1-Small](images/SolarTracker-1-Small.png)

## SIMPLE SONIC DETECTOR

This is a simple feedback circuit that produces
a whistle called a FEEDBACK WHISTLE.

![SonicDetector](images/SonicDetector.png)

This terrible sound was very common in old amplifiers when the microphone
was placed too near the speaker.

All you need is a high-gain amplifier and a microphone. We have used a piezo
diaphragm for both the microphone and speaker.

The circuit works best on 12v but will produce good results on 6v or 9v.

Vary the distance between the two piezos and turn one over and lift it off
the bench to see the different effects and range. Move your hand closer to
the piezos and see how the frequency changes. This is due to the length of
the wave and if you are located at a distance where the wave does not add
to the vibration of the receiving diaphragm, you get silence.

The Circuit produces a FEEDBACK WHISTLE

## MAGNETIC DOOR LOCK DELAY

![MagDoorLatchDelay](images/MagDoorLatchDelay.png)

This circuit turns OFF the Magnetic Door Lock for 10 second to 30 seconds to
allow you to enter. It turns ON after 10 seconds to 30 seconds.

## 5 SECOND ALARM

This circuit operates the alarm for 5 seconds, even if the switch is kept
closed:

![PiezoAlarmBottom](images/PiezoAlarmBottom.jpg)

![PiezoAlarmBottom-2](images/PiezoAlarmBottom-2.jpg)

The original reed switch can be used but the bottom connection to the
board must be isolated and re-wired.  The reed switch cannot be de-soldered as
it will fall apart. Change the value of the 4u7 electrolytic to increase the
time. Closing the switch (in the circuit diagram above) operates the alarm.

When the voltage between the middle terminal of the slide switch and the lower
terminal is reduced to 0v, the circuit operates. A very small current comes
from the COB module via the middle pin of the slide switch and this current
charges the 4u7 to 4.5v and the circuit turns OFF.

At the same time the two 22u are fully discharged.  When the switch is closed,
the 4u7 is discharged via the two 22u electrolytics and the alarm is activated.
If the switch is immediately released, the 4u7 takes time to charge via the COB
module.

If the switch is kept closed, the COB module charges the 4u7 and the 22u
electrolytics and eventually turns OFF. If the switch is now opened, the 22u
electrolytics discharge via the 1M.  This takes a considerable time and the
alarm cannot be re-activated for a few seconds.
