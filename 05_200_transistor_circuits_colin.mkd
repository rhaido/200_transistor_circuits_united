# TRANSISTOR CIRCUITS, Part I

## SAFE 240v SUPPLY

When working on any project that connects to the "mains,"
it is important to take all precautions to prevent electrocution.

This project
provides 240v AC but the current it limited to 60mA if a 15 watt transformer is
used. Although the output can produce a nasty shock and the voltage will kill
you, the circuit provides isolation from the mains and if a short-circuit
occurs, it will not blow a fuse, but the transformers will get very hot as
start to buzz.

You can use any two identical transformers and the wattage of
either transformer will determine the maximum output wattage.

If you don't use identical transformers, the output voltage will be higher or
lower than the "mains" voltage and the wattage will be determined by the
smaller transformer.

![Safe 240 Sypply](images/Safe240vSupply.png)

This arrangement is not perfectly safe, but is the best you can get when
working on projects such as switch-mode power supplies, capacitor-fed
down-lights etc. 

## RECHARGEABLE BATTERY CAPACITY

This simple circuit tests the capacity of a rechargeable cell. Connect a 4R7
(yellow-purple-gold-gold) resistor across the terminals of a clock mechanism
and fit a fully charged rechargeable cell. Set the hands to 12 O'Clock and the
clock will let you know how long the cell lasted until the voltage reached
about 0.8v. Now fit another cell and see how long it lasts. You cannot work
out the exact capacity of a cell but you can compare one cell with another. The
initial current is about 250mA for a 1.2v cell.

![Clock+4R7](images/Clock4R7.png)

## BLOWN FUSE INDICATOR

This circuit indicates when a fuse is "blown".

![Blown Fuse Indicator](images/BlownFuse.png)

## PLANT NEEDS WATERING

This circuit indicates when the soil is dry and the plant needs watering. The
circuit does not have a current-limiting resistor because the base resistor is
very high and the current through the transistor is only 2mA. Don't change the
supply voltage or the 220k as these two values are correct for this circuit.

![Soil Dryness Indicator](images/PlantWater.png)

## THE SOLAR PANEL

This will clear-up a lot of mysteries of the solar panel.

Many solar panels produce 16v - 18v when lightly loaded, while other 12v solar
panels will not charge a 12v battery.

Some panels say "nominal voltage," some do not give any value other than 6v or
12v, and some specify the wrong voltage. You can't work with vague
specifications. You need to know accurate details to charge a battery from a
solar panel. 

There are 3 things you have to know before buying a panel or connecting a panel
to a battery:

1. The **UNLOADED VOLTAGE**.
1. The voltage of the panel when delivering the rated current. Called the **RATED VOLTAGE**.
1. The **CURRENT**.

- The **UNLOADED VOLTAGE** is the voltage produced by the panel when it is lightly
    loaded. This voltage is very important because a 12v battery will produce a
    "floating voltage" of about 15v when it is fully charged and it will gradually
    rise to this voltage during the charging period. This means the panel must be
    able to deliver more than 15v so it will charge a 12v battery.

    Sometimes there is a diode and a charging circuit between the panel and
    battery and these devices will drop a small voltage, so the panel must produce
    a voltage high enough to allow for them.

    The **Unloaded Voltage** can sometimes be determined by
    counting the number of cells on the panel as each cell will produce 0.6v.

    If you cannot see the individual cells, use a multimeter to read the voltage under
    good illumination and watch the voltage rise. You can place a 100 ohm resistor
    across the panel to take readings.
- The **RATED VOLTAGE** is the guaranteed voltage the panel will deliver when
   full current is flowing.

    This can also be called the Nominal Voltage, however don't take anything for
    certain. Take readings of your own. The Rated Voltage (and current ) is
    produced when the panel receives bright sunlight. This may occur for only a
    very small portion of the day.

    You can clearly see the 11 cells of this panel and it produces 6.6v when
    lightly loaded. It will barely produce 6v when loaded and this is **NOT ENOUGH** to
    charge a 6v battery.

    ![6.8v Panel](images/6_8vSolarPanel.jpg)

    This panel claims to be 18v, but it clearly only produces 14.4v. This is
    not suitable for charging a 12v battery. When you add a protection diode, the
    output voltage will be 13.8v. A flat battery being charged will reach 13.8v
    very quickly and it will not be charged any further. That's why the output
    voltage of a panel is so important.

    ![18v Panel](images/18vSolarPanel.jpg)

    This is a genuine 18v panel:

    ![Genuine 18v Panel](images/18vSolarPanel-2.jpg)

    The panel needs to produce 17v to 18v so it will have a small "overhead"
    voltage when the battery reaches 14.4v and it will still be able to supply
    energy into the battery to complete the charging process.
- The **RATED CURRENT** is the maximum current the panel will produce when
    receiving full sunlight. The current of a panel can be worked out by
    knowing the wattage and dividing by the unloaded voltage. A 20 watt 18v panel
    will deliver about 1 amp.  

### Charging a Battery
A solar panel can be used to directly charge a battery without any other components. Simply connect the panel to the battery and it will charge when the panel receives bright sunlight - providing the panel produces a voltage least 30% to 50% more than the battery you are charging.

**The voltage of the panel does not matter and the voltage of the battery does
not matter. You can connect any panel to any battery** - providing the panel
can produce a voltage least 30% to 50% more than the battery you are charging.

The output voltage of the panel will simply adapt to the voltage of the
battery. Even though there is a voltage mismatch, there is NO "lost" or
wasted energy. An 18v panel "drives into" a 12v battery with the maximum
current it can produce when the intensity of the sun is a maximum.

To prevent too-much mismatch, it is suggested you keep the panel voltage to
within 150% of the battery voltage, for example:

- 6v battery - 9v max panel
- 12v battery - 18v max panel
- 24v battery - 36v max panel

But here's the important point: to prevent overcharging the battery, the
wattage of the panel is important. If the wattage of an 18v panel is 6watts,
the current is 6/18 = 0.33 amps = 330mA. To prevent overcharging a battery, the
charging current should not be more than one-tenth its amp-hr capacity.

For instance, a 2,000mAhr set of cells should not be charged at a rate higher
than 200mA for 14 hours. This is called its 14-hour rate. But this rating is a
CONSTANT RATING and since a solar panel produces an output for about 8 hours
per day, you can increase the charging current to 330mA for 8 hours. This will
deliver the energy to fully charge the cells. 

That's why a 6 watt panel can be directly connected to a set of (nearly fully
discharged) 2,000mAhr cells. For a 12v 1.2AHr battery, the charging current
will be 100mA for 12 hours or 330mA for 4 hours and a regulator circuit will be
needed to prevent overcharging. For a 12v 4.5AHr battery, the charging current
will be 375mA for 12 hours and a larger panel will be needed.

### Adding a Diode

Some solar panels will discharge the battery (a small amount) when it is not
receiving sunlight and a diode can be added to prevent discharge. This diode
drops 0.6v when the panel is operating and will reduce the maximum current
(slightly) when the panel is charging the battery. If the diode is Schottky,
the voltage-drop is 0.35v. Some panels include this diode - called a BYPASS
DIODE.

### Preventing Overcharging

There are two ways to prevent overcharging the battery.

1. Discharge the battery nearly fully each night and use a panel that will only
   deliver 120% of the amp-hour capacity of the battery the following day.
1. Add a **VOLTAGE REGULATOR**.

Here is the simplest and cheapest regulator to charge a 12v battery.
Full details of how the circuit works and setting up the circuit is
[HERE](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/200TrCcts/101-200TrCcts.html#84).
The solar panel must be able to produce at least 16v on NO LOAD (25-28 cells).
The diagram only shows a 24 cell panel - it should be 28 cells.

The only other thing you have to consider is the wattage of the panel. This
will depend on how fast you want to charge the battery and/or how much energy
you remove from the battery each day and/or the amp-Hr capacity of the battery.
For instance, a 12v 1.2A-Hr battery contains 14watt-hours of energy. An 6watt
panel (16v to 18v) will deliver 18watt-hours (in bright sunlight) in 3 hours.
The battery will be fully charged in 3 hours.

### Solar Battery Charger/Regulator

The pot is adjusted so the relay drops-out at 13.7v. The charger will turn ON
when the voltage drops to about 12.5v. The 100R Dummy LOAD will absorb 3.25
watts and that is the maximum wattage the panel will produce with 100R load. 

![Solar Panel Charger](images/SolarBatteryCharger.png)

### Charge Current

Here is a very clever circuit to find the charging current, if you don't have a multimeter. 

![Solar Panel Charger](images/SolarBatteryCharger-2.png)

Connect a 22R 0.25 watt resistor in series with the battery and hold your
finger on the resistor. The resistor will get very hot if 100mA or more is
flowing. **This resistor will indicate ONE WATT** of energy is flowing into
the battery, but we are using a 0.25 watt resistor to measure the heat as this
represents "LOST ENERGY" and we want to keep the losses to a minimum. To get
some idea of 0.25watt of heat, place a 560R 0.25watt resistor across the
terminals of a battery. This is 250mW of heat and is your reference.

A 1.2A-Hr 12 volt battery has 14 watts of energy and if you are charging at
ONE WATT, it will take about 16 hours to fully charge the battery.

This circuit can be used when charging a battery from your car, from a solar
panel, a battery charger or a pulsed solar-charging circuit. It is also a
SAFETY CIRCUIT as it will limit the current to 100mA. If the current is higher
than 130mA, the resistor will hot and start to smell. 

Note: when the 22R is removed, the current flowing into the battery WILL
INCREASE. The increase may be only 10% from some chargers, but can be as high
as 100% OR MORE if the battery is connected to the cigarette lighter plug in
your car.

## HIGH-LOW VOLTAGE CUT-OUT

![High-Low Voltage Cutout](images/High-LowVoltageCutout.png)

This circuit will turn off the relay when the voltage is above or below the
"set-points."; You need either a variable power supply or a 12v battery and an
extra 1.5v battery. Turn the LOW voltage cutout trim pot to mid way and
connect the 13.5v supply. Turn the HIGH voltage trim pot to the high end and
the relay will turn off. Now turn the 1.5v battery around the other way and
adjust the LOW voltage trim pot to the 10.5v supply. 

## TRANSISTOR TESTER 1

<!-- lite -->![Tansistor Tester 1](images/TrTester.png)

**Transistor Tester - 1** project will test all types of transistors including
Darlington and power. The circuit is set to test NPN types. To test PNP types,
connect the 9v battery around the other way at points A and B. 

The transformer in the photo is a 10mH choke with 150 turns of 0.01mm wire
wound over the 10mH winding. The two original pins (with the red and black
leads) go to the primary winding and the fine wires are called the Sec.

Connect the transformer either way in the circuit and if it does not work,
reverse either the primary or secondary (but not both).

Almost any transformer will work and any speaker will be suitable. If you use
the speaker transformer described in the [HOME-MADE SPEAKER TRANSFORMER]
article, use one-side of the primary.

<!-- full -->![Transistor Tester 1 Combo](images/TrTester_and_10mHTransformer.jpg)

## TRANSISTOR TESTER 2

Here is another transistor tester. This is basically a high gain amplifier with
feedback that causes the LED to flash at a rate determined by the 10u and 330k
resistor.

Remove one of the transistors and insert the unknown transistor. When it is
NPN with the pins as shown in the photo, the LED will flash. To turn the unit
off, remove one of the transistors.

![Transistor Tester 2](images/TrTester-2-schem_and_soldered.jpg)

## TRANSISTOR and LED TESTER 3
Here is another transistor tester. And it also tests LEDs. See the full
project: [Transistor Tester](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Transistor%20Tester/TransistorTester.html). This circuit is basically a Joule Thief design with
the coil (actually a transformer) increasing the 1.5v supply to a higher
voltage to illuminate one or two LEDs in series. The "LED Test" terminals uses
the full voltage produced by the circuit and it will test any colour LED
including a white LED. The two "coils" are wound on a 10mm dia pen with 0.1mm
wire (very fine wire). All the components fit on a small PC board. A kit of
parts for the project is a available from Talking Electronics for $4.00 plus
$3.00 postage.

## TRANSISTOR TESTER - 4 with ELECTROLYTIC TESTER

![Transistor Tester 4 with Electrolytic Tester](images/TrTester-4.png)

This circuit will test transistors  and electrolytic capacitors from 1u to 220u
for leakage, open, shorts and approx capacitance.

Build the circuit on a strip of PC board as shown in Transistor Tester-2 so the
transistors can be replaced with a suspect transistor and an electrolytic can
be fitted in place of the link for the capacitor.

When an electrolytic is fitted to the circuit, it will produce a wailing and
eventually stop. If the tone continues, the electrolytic is leaky.

If the tone is not produced, the electrolytic is open. If the tone does not
change, the electrolytic is shorted.

## WORLDS SIMPLEST CIRCUIT

This is the simplest circuit you can get. Any NPN transistor can be used.


<!-- full -->![Simplest Circuit](images/SimplestCct-1TrSchemPhoto.png)
<!-- lite -->![Simplest Circuit Schematics](images/SimplestCct-1TrSchematic.png)

Connect the LED, 220 ohm resistor and transistor as shown in the photo.

Touch the top point with two fingers of one hand and the lower point with
fingers of the other hand and squeeze.

The LED will turn on brighter when you squeeze harder.

Your body has resistance and when a voltage is present, current will flow
though your body (fingers). The transistor is amplifying the current through
your fingers about 200 times and this is enough to illuminate the LED.

## SECOND SIMPLEST CIRCUIT
<!-- lite -->![Schematics](images/SimplestCct-2TrSchematic.png)
<!-- full -->![Schematics and Photo](images/SimplestCct-2TrSchemaPhoto.png)

This the second simplest circuit in the world. A second transistor has been
added in place of your fingers. This transistor has a gain of about 200 and
when you touch the points shown on the diagram, the LED will illuminate with
the slightest touch. The transistor has amplified the current (through your
fingers) about 200 times. 

## 8 MILLION GAIN!
This circuit is so sensitive it will detect "mains hum". Simply move it across
any wall and it will detect where the mains cable is located. It has a gain of
about 200 x 200 x 200 = 8,000,000 and will also detect static electricity and
the presence of your hand without any direct contact. You will be amazed what
it detects!

There is static electricity EVERYWHERE! The input of this circuit
is classified as very high impedance.

![Schematics](images/SimplestCct-3TrSchematic.png)

<!-- full -->![photo1](images/SimplestCct-3TrPhoto.jpg)

<!-- full -->![photo2](images/6millionGain.jpg)

## MAINS HUM DETECTOR
This simple circuit will detect if a cable is carrying the "Mains." The piezo
diaphragm is will let you hear the hum:

Do not touch the copper wire. Only
place the detector near the plastic covering. It will work at 2cm from the
cable

![Schematics](images/MainsHum-2.png)

## FINDING THE NORTH POLE
The diagrams show that a North Pole will be produced when the positive of a
battery is connected to wire wound in the direction shown. This is Flemmings
Right Hand Rule and applies to motors, solenoids and coils and anything wound
like the turns in the diagram. 

![Illustration](images/N-S-polarity.png)

## HOME-MADE SPEAKER TRANSFORMER

![sch and photo](images/SpkrTransfSymPhoto.png)

The **speaker transformer** is made by winding 50 turns of 0.25mm wire on a small
length of 10mm dia ferrite rod.

The size and length of the rod does not matter - it is just the number of turns
that makes the transformer work. This is called the secondary winding.

The primary winding is made by winding 300 turns of 0.1mm wire (this is very
fine wire) over the secondary and ending with a loop of wire we call the centre
tap.

Wind another 300 turns and this completes the transformer.

It does not matter which end of the secondary is connected to the top of the
speaker and it does not matter which end of the primary is connected to the
collector of the transistor in the circuits in this book.

## SUPER EAR

This circuit is a very sensitive 3-transistor amplifier using a speaker
transformer. This can be wound on a short length of ferrite rod as show above
or 150 turns on a 10mH choke. The biasing of the middle transistor is set for
3v supply. The second and third transistors are not turned on during idle
conditions and the quiescent current is just 5mA.

The project is ideal for listening to conversations or TV etc in another room
with long leads connecting the microphone to the amplifier.

## LED FLASHER WITH ONE TRANSISTOR!

This is a novel flasher circuit using a single driver transistor that takes its
flash-rate from a flashing LED. The flasher in the photo is 3mm. An ordinary
LED will not work.

The flash rate cannot be altered, but the brightness of the
high-bright white LED can be adjusted by altering the 1k resistor across the
100u electrolytic to 4k7 or 10k.

The 1k resistor discharges the 100u so that when the transistor turns on, the
charging current into the 100u illuminates the white LED. If a 10k discharge
resistor is used, the 100u is not fully discharged and the LED does not flash
as bright. All the parts in the photo are in the same places as in the circuit
diagram to make it easy to see how the parts are connected.

![1Tr LED Flasher](images/Flasher-1Tr-combo.jpg)

**The circuit uses a flashing LED to flash a super-bright 20,000mcd white LED**

## LED FLASHER

These two circuits will flash a LED very bright and consume less than 2mA
average current. Both circuits can use a transistor with a larger current
capability for the second transistor. The first circuit needs a PNP transistor
and the second circuit needs an NPN transistor if a number of LEDs need to be
driven. The second circuit is the basis for a [SIMPLE MOTOR SPEED CONTROL]. See
the note on how the 330k works, in Flashing Two LEDs below. 

![LED Flasher](images/LED_Flasher.png)

## FLASHING TWO LEDS

These two circuits will flash two LEDs very bright and consume less than 2mA
average current. They require 6v supply. The 330k may need to be 470k to
produce flashing on 6v as 330k turns on the first transistor too much and the
10u does not turn the first transistor off a small amount when it becomes fully
charged and thus cycling is not produced. 

![2-LED Flasher](images/LED_Flasher_2LEDs.png)

## 1.5v LED FLASHER

This will flash a LED, using a single 1.5v cell. It may even flash a white LED
even though this type of LED needs about 3.2v to 3.6v for operation. The
circuit takes about 2mA but produces a very bright flash.

My circuit has been copied by Eleccircuit.com but my layout makes it much
easier to see how the circuit works.

![1.5v LED Flasher](images/1v5LEDflasher.png)

## LED on 1.5v SUPPLY

![LED on 1.5v Supply](images/LED_on1v5_Supply.png)

A red LED requires about 1.7v before it will start to illuminate - below this
voltage - NOTHING! This circuit takes about 12mA to illuminate a red LED using
a single cell, but the interesting feature is the way the LED is illuminated. 

The 1u electrolytic can be considered to be a 1v cell. (If you want to be
technical: it charges to about 1.5v - 0.2v loss due to collector-emitter = 1.3v
and a lost of about 0.2v via collector-emitter in diagram B.)

It is firstly charged by the 100R resistor and the 3rd transistor (when it is
fully turned ON via the 1k base resistor). This is shown in diagram "A."

During this time the second transistor is not turned on and that's why we have
omitted it from the diagram. When the second transistor is turned ON, the 1v
cell is pulled to the 0v rail and the negative of the cell is actually 1v below
the 0v rail as shown in diagram "B." 

The LED sees 1.5v from the battery and about 1v from the electrolytic and this
is sufficient to illuminate it. Follow the two voltages to see how they add to
2.5v.

## 3v WHITE LED FLASHER

![3v WHITE LED FLASHER](images/3vWhiteLEDflasher.png)

This will flash a white LED, on 3v supply and produce a very bright flash. The
circuit produces a voltage higher than 5v if the LED is not in circuit but the
LED limits the voltage to its characteristic voltage of 3.2v to 3.6v. The
circuit takes about 2mA an is actually a voltage-doubler (voltage incrementer)
arrangement. 

Note the 10k charges the 100u. It does not illuminate the LED because the 100u
is charging and the voltage across it is always less than 3v. When the two
transistors conduct, the collector of the BC557 rises to rail voltage and pulls
the 100u HIGH. The negative of the 100u effectively sits just below the
positive rail and the positive of the electro is about 2v higher than this. All
the energy in the electro is pumped into the LED to produce a very bright
flash.

## BRIGHT FLASH FROM FLAT BATTERY

![BRIGHT FLASH FROM FLAT BATTERY](images/WhiteLEDflasher-2.png)

This circuit will flash a white LED, on a supply from 2v to 6v and produce a
very bright flash. The circuit takes about 2mA and old cells can be used. The
two 100u electros in parallel produce a better flash when the supply is 6v. 

## BIKE FLASHER

![Bike Flasher](images/BikeFlasher.png)

This circuit will flash a white LED (or 2,3 4 LEDs in parallel) at 2.7Hz,
suitable for the rear light on a bike.

## BIKE FLASHER - Amazing!
This bike flasher uses a single transistor to flash two white LEDs from a
single cell. And it has no core for the transformer - just AIR! 

All Joule Thief circuits you have seen, use a ferrite rod or toroid (doughnut)
core and the turns are wound on the ferrite material. But this circuit proves
the collapsing magnetic flux produces an increased voltage, even when the core
is AIR. The fact is this: When a magnetic filed collapses quickly, it produces
a higher voltage in the opposite direction and in this case the magnetic field
surrounding the coil is sufficient to produce the energy we need. 

Wind 30 turns on 10mm (1/2" dia) pen or screwdriver and then another 30 turns
on top. Build the first circuit and connect the wires. You can use 1 or two
LEDs. If the circuit does not work, swap the wires going to the base. 

Now add the 10u electrolytic and 100k resistor (remove the 1k5). The circuit
will now flash. You must use 2 LEDs for the flashing circuit.

![BIKE FLASHER - Amazing!](images/BikeFlasher-Amazing-1.png)

### THE IMPROVED BIKE FLASHER CIRCUIT

The secret to getting the maximum energy from the coil (to flash the LEDs) is
the maximum amount of air in the centre of the coil. Air cannot transfer a high
magnetic flux (density) so we provide a large area (volume) of low flux
(density) to provide the energy. The larger (20mm) coil reduced the current
from 20mA to 11mA for the same brightness. This could be improved further but
the coil gets too big. The two 30-turn windings must be kept together because
the flux from the main winding must cut the feedback winding to turn ON the
transistor HARD. 

When the transistor starts to turn on via the 100k, it creates magnetic flux in
the main winding that cuts the feedback winding and a positive voltage comes
out the end connected to the base and a negative voltage comes out the end
connected to the 100k and 10u. This turns the transistor ON more and it
continues to turn ON until fully turned ON. At this point the magnetic flux is
not expanding and the voltage does not appear in the feedback winding. 

During this time the 10u has charged and the voltage on the negative lead has
dropped to a lower voltage than before. This effectively turns OFF the
transistor and the current in the main winding ceases abruptly. The magnetic
flux collapses and produces a voltage in the opposite direction that is higher
than the supply and this is why the two LEDs illuminate. This also puts a
voltage through the feedback winding that keeps the transistor OFF. When the
magnetic flux has collapsed, the voltage on the negative lead of the 10u is so
low that the transistor does not turn on. The 100k discharges the 10u and the
voltage on the base rises to start the next cycle.      

You can see the 100k and 1k5 resistors and all the other parts in a "birds
nest" (in the photo above), to allow easy experimenting.  

This is the first circuit you should build to flash a white LED from a single
cell. 

It covers many features and shows how the efficiency of a LED increases when it
is pulsed very briefly with a high current.  

The two coils form a TRANSFORMER and show how a collapsing magnetic field
produces a high voltage (we use 6v of this high voltage). 

The 10u and 100k form a delay circuit to produce the flashing effect. 

You can now go to all the other Joule Thief circuits and see how they "missed
the boat" by not experimenting fully to simply their circuits. That's why a
"birds nest" arrangement is essential to encourage experimenting.  

**Note**: Changing the turns to 40t for the main winding and 20t for the
feedback (keeping the turns tightly wound together by winding wire around them)
reduced the current to 8-9mA. 

The circuit can be made small by using a ferrite slug 2.6mm diam x 7.6mm long.
The inductance of this transformer is quite critical and the voltage across the
LEDs must be over 6v for the circuit to work. It will not work with one or two
LEDs. It needs THREE LEDs!!!

If the author not not keep experimenting, he would have missed this amazing feature !!

![Bike Flasher with the Ferrite Slug](images/BikeFlasher-Amazing-2.png)

## 10 LEDs - any colour - ON 9v BATTERY

![10 LEDs on 9v battery](images/10LEDs9v.png)

A very high efficiency circuit; for the transformer use 0.25mm wire, wind 200
turns around any nut and bolt (M5, 25mm long); for a **good** brightness use
10k resistor (curren 25mA); use 3k3 for a very bright light (50 mA). If LEDs do
not illuminate, reverse leads _X_ and _Y_ of the inductor

## DUAL 3v WHITE LED FLASHER

![Dual 3v White LED Flasher](images/Dual3vWhiteLEDflasher.png)

This circuit alternately flashes two white LEDs, on a 3v supply and produces a
very bright flash. The circuit produces a voltage higher than 5v if the LED is
not in circuit but the LED limits the voltage to its characteristic voltage of
3.2v to 3.6v.

The circuit takes about 2mA and is actually a voltage-doubler (voltage
incrementer) arrangement. The 1k charges the 100u and the diode drops 0.6v to
prevent the LED from starting to illuminate on 3v. When a transistor conducts,
the collector pulls the 100u down towards the 0v rail and the negative of the
electro is actually about 2v below the 0v rail. The LED sees 3v + 2v and
illuminates very brightly when the voltage reaches about 3.4v.

All the energy in the electro is pumped into the LED to produce a very bright
flash.

## DUAL 1v5 WHITE LED FLASHER

![Dual 1v5 While Led Flasher](images/Dual1v5WhiteLEDflasher.png)

This circuit alternately flashes two white LEDs, on a 1.5v supply and produces
a very bright flash. The circuit produces a voltage of about 25v when the LEDs
are not connected, but the LEDs reduce this as they have a characteristic
voltage-drop across them when they are illuminated. Do not use a supply voltage
higher than 1.5v.

The circuit takes about 10mA. 

The transformer consists of 30 turns of very fine wire on a 1.6mm slug 6mm
long, but any ferrite bead or slug can be used. The number of turns is not
critical. 

The 1n is important and using any other value or connecting it to the positive
line will increase the supply current. 

Using LEDs other than white will alter the flash-rate considerably and both
LEDs must be the same colour. 

## LED FLASHES 3 TIMES WHEN POWER IS APPLIED

![3-timer :)](images/LED-Flashes3Times.png)

This circuits uses a FLASHING LED - not an ordinary LED. 

- When the circuit turns ON, the electrolytic is uncharged and the
  charging-current turns on the transistor. This makes the LED flash. 
- The value of the 47u and 100k will depend on how many times you want the LED to
  flash. 
- The 1N4148 diode discharges the electrolytic when the power is turned off so
  the circuit will start immediately the power is applied. This diode is not
  needed if the circuit is turned off for a long time.

## DANCING FLOWER

![Dancing Flower](images/DancingFlower.png)

This circuit was taken from a dancing flower. 

A motor at the base of the flower had a shaft up the stem and when the
microphone detected music, the bent shaft made the flower wiggle and move.  

The circuit will respond to a whistle, music or noise. 

## DANCING FLOWER with SPEED CONTROL

![Dancing Flower with Speed Control](images/DancingFlower2.png)

The Dancing Flower circuit can be combined with the Motor Speed Control circuit
to produce a requirement from one of the readers.

## WHITE LINE FOLLOWER

![White Line Follower](images/WhiteLineFollower.png)

This circuit can be used for a toy car to follow a white line. The motor is
either a 3v type with gearing to steer the car or a rotary actuator or a servo
motor.

When equal light is detected by the photo resistors the voltage on the base of
the first transistor will be mid rail and the circuit is adjusted via the 2k2
pot so the motor does not receive any voltage. When one of the LDR's receives
more (or less) light, the motor is activated. And the same thing happens when
the other LDR receives less or more light.

## LED DETECTS LIGHT

![LED Detects Light](images/LEDdetectsLight.png)

All LEDs give off light of a particular colour but some LEDs are also able to
detect light. Obviously they are not as good as a device that has been
specially made to detect light; such as solar cell, photocell, photo resistor,
light dependent resistor, photo transistor, photo diode and other photo
sensitive devices. 

A green LED will detect light and a high-bright red LED will respond about 100
times better than a green LED, but the LED in this position in the circuit is
classified as very high impedance and it requires a considerable amount of
amplification to turn the detection into a worthwhile current-source. 

All other LEDs respond very poorly and are not worth trying. 

The accompanying circuit amplifies the output of the LED and enables it to be
used for a number of applications.  The LED only responds when the light enters
the end of the LED and this makes it ideal for solar trackers and any time
there is a large difference between the dark and light conditions. It will not
detect the light in a room unless the lamp is very close.

## 12v RELAY ON 6V SUPPLY 

![12v Relay on 6v Supply](images/12vRelayon6v.png)

This circuit allows a 12v relay to operate on a 6v or 9v supply. Most 12v
relays need about 12v to "pull-in" but will "hold" on about 6v. The 220u
charges via the 2k2 and bottom diode. When an input above 1.5v is applied to
the input of the circuit, both transistors are turned ON and the 5v across the
electrolytic causes the negative end of the electro to go below the 0v rail by
about 4.5v and this puts about 10v across the relay.

Alternatively you can rewind a 12v relay by removing about half the turns.
Join up what is left to the terminals. Replace the turns you took off, by
connecting them in parallel with the original half, making sure the turns go
the same way around

## MAKE TIME FLY!

![Make time fly](images/MakeTimeFly.png)

Connect this circuit to an old electronic clock mechanism and speed up the
motor 100 times! 

The "motor" is a simple "stepper-motor" that performs a half-rotation each time
the electromagnet is energised. It normally takes 2 seconds for one revolution.
But our circuit is connected directly to the winding and the frequency can be
adjusted via the pot. 

Take the mechanism apart, remove the 32kHz crystal and cut one track to the
electromagnet. Connect the circuit below via wires and re-assemble the clock.  

As you adjust the pot, the "seconds hand" will move clockwise or anticlockwise
and you can watch the hours "fly by" or make "time go backwards."

The multivibrator section needs strong buffering to drive the 2,800 ohm
inductive winding of the motor and that's why push-pull outputs have been used.
The flip-flop circuit cannot drive the highly inductive load directly (it
upsets the waveform enormously). 

From a 6v supply, the motor only gets about 4v due to the voltage drops across
the transistors. Consumption is about 5mA.

## CONSTANT CURRENT SOURCE

![Constant Current Source](images/ConstantCurrent-x.png)

This circuit provides a constant current to the LED. The LED can be replaced by
any other component and the current through it will depend on the value of R2.
Suppose R2 is 560R. When 1mA flows through R2,  0.56v will develop across this
resistor and begin to turn on the BC547. This will rob the base of BD 679 with
turn-on voltage and the transistor turns off slightly. If the supply voltage
increases, this will try to increase the current through the circuit. If the
current tries to increase, the voltage across R2 increases and the BD 679 turns
off more and the additional voltage appears across the BD 679.  

If R2 is 56R, the current through the circuit will be 10mA. If R2 is 5R6, the
current through the circuit will be 100mA - although you cannot pass 100mA
through a LED without damaging it.

## LED driver for 12v CAR

![Constant Current for 12v Car](images/ConstantCurrentfor12vCar.png)

Here is a simple circuit that will drive any number of LEDs in a single string
with a constant 25mA without having to work out the  value of the dropper
resistor. You can use up to 6 red LED or up to 3 white LEDs with the same
circuit.

The supply can be 12v to 16v without the brightness altering.

## LED driver IR LEDs in a 12v CAR

![LED driver IR LEDs in a 12v Car](images/ConstantCurrentforIR-LEDs12vCar.png)

This circuit will drive up to 7 IR LEDs at a constant current of 70mA from a
12v supply.

These LEDs will illuminate ultra-violet sensitive paint to produce a white
glow.

## CONSTANT CURRENT SOURCE: circuits 2 & 3

By rearranging the components in the circuit above, it can be designed to turn
ON or OFF via an input.

![Constant Current Circuits 2 and 3](images/ConstantCurrent-2_3.png)

The current through the LED (or LEDs) is determined by the value of *R*:

- 5mA:   R = 120R or 150R
- 10mA:  R = 68R
- 15mA:  R = 47R
- 20mA:  R = 33R
- 25mA:  R = 22R or 33R
- 30mA:  R = 22R

## CONSTANT CURRENT SOURCE - Circuit 4

![Constant Current 4 & 5](images/ConstantCurrent-4-5.png)

The output will be limited to 100mA by using a red LED and 10R for Re. 
The output will be limited to 500mA by using a red LED and 2R2 for Re.

BC328  - 800mA max

Use a BD140 in the first circuit and the output will be limited to 1A by using a red LED and 1R0 for Re.

5watt LEDs (sometimes called "White Big Chip LEDs") have a characteristic
voltage across them of 3.2v and draw 1.75amp.  1, 2 or 3 can be connected in
series to the second circuit using a heatsinked BD140 transistor.

## ON - OFF VIA MOMENTARY PUSH-BUTTONS 

![On-Off via two buttonts](images/On-OFF-Cct.png)

_See Also Push-ON  Push-OFF (in 101-200 Circuits)_

This circuit will supply current to the load RL. The maximum current will
depend on the second transistor. The circuit is turned on via the "ON" push
button and this action puts a current through the load and thus a voltage
develops across the load. This voltage is passed to the PNP transistor and it
turns ON. The collector of the PNP keeps the power transistor ON.

To turn the circuit OFF, the "OFF" button is pressed momentarily. The 1k
between base and emitter of the power transistor prevents the base floating or
receiving any slight current from the PNP transistor that would keep the
circuit latched ON.

The circuit was originally designed by a Professor of Engineering at Penn State
University. It had 4 mistakes - so much for testing a circuit!!

## SIREN

![Siren](images/Siren-discrete.png)

This circuit produces a wailing or siren sound that gradually increases and
decreases in frequency as the 100u charges and discharges when the push-button
is pressed and released.

In other words, the circuit is not automatic. You
need to press the button and release it to produce the up/down sound. 

## TICKING BOMB

![Ticking Bomb](images/TickingBomb.png)

This circuit produces a sound similar to a loud clicking clock. The frequency
of the tick is adjusted by the 220k pot. 

The circuit starts by charging the 2u2 and when 0.65v is on the base of the NPN
transistor, it starts to turn on. This turns on the BC 557 and the voltage on
the collector rises. This pushes the small charge on the 2u2 into the base of
the BC547 to turn it on more. 

This continues when the negative end of the 2u2 is above 0.65v and now the
electro starts to charge in the opposite direction until both transistors are
fully turned on. The BC 547 receives less current into the base and it starts
to turn off. Both transistors turn off very quickly and the cycle starts again.

## LIE DETECTOR-1

![Lie Detector 1](images/LieDetector.png)

This circuit detects the resistance between your fingers to produce an
oscillation. The detection-points will detect resistances as high as 300k and
as the resistance decreases, the frequency increases.

Separate the two touch pads and attach them to the back of each hand. As the
subject feels nervous, he will sweat and change the frequency of the circuit.

The photos show the circuit built on PC boards with separate touch pads.

## LIE DETECTOR-2

![Lie Detector 2](images/LieDetector-2.png)

This circuit detects the resistance between your fingers to turn on the FALSE
LED. The circuit sits with the TRUE LED illuminated. The 47k pot is adjusted to
allow the LEDs to change state when touching the probes.

## LIE DETECTOR-3

![Lie Detector 3](images/LieDetector-3.png)

This circuit detects the resistance between your fingers to turn the 4 LEDs. As
you press harder, more LEDs are illuminated.

## LIE DETECTOR-4

![Lie Detector 4](images/LieDetector-4.png)

This circuit detects the resistance between your fingers to turn the 3LEDs. As
you press harder, more LEDs are illuminated.  The circuit is simpler than Lie
Detector-3.

## TOUCH SWITCH - globe

![Touch Switch - Globe](images/TouchSwitch.png)

This circuit detects the skin resistance of a finger to deliver a very small
current to the super-alpha pair of transistors to turn the circuit ON. The
output of the "super transistor" turns on the BC 557 transistor. The voltage on
the top of the globe is passed to the front of the circuit via the 4M7 to take
the place of your finger and the circuit remains ON.

To turn the circuit OFF, a finger on the OFF pads will activate the first
transistor and this will rob the "super transistor" of voltage and the circuit
will turn OFF.

This project is available as a kit of parts from Talking Electronics for $6.00
plus $4.00 postage.

## TOUCH SWITCH - LED

![Touch Switch - LED](images/TouchSwitch-LED.png)

This circuit turns a LED on and off.

## TOUCH SWITCH - LED - modification by Mike Grozak 

![Touch Switch - LED](images/TouchSwitch-LED-2.png)

To make the circuit come ON with the LED not illuminated, you need to put a
"set" on the circuit.  A "set" is a particular condition that may be ON or OFF
but the fact is the circuit ALWAYS starts in a particular way.

The 10n prevents a voltage appearing on the base of the BC557 transistor when
the circuit is turned ON and this means the transistor is OFF. The feedback
line will not have any voltage on it and thus the second and third transistor
will not be turned ON.  Thus the circuit will come ON with the LED not
illuminated.

## TOUCH SWITCH-2

![Touch Switch - LED](images/TouchSwitch-2.png)

This circuit detects the skin resistance of a finger to turn the circuit ON for
about 1 second. The output can be taken to a counting circuit. The circuit
consumes no current when in quiescent mode:

## TOUCH SWITCH-3

![Touch Switch - LED](images/TouchSw-3.png)

This circuit stays ON.

## CODE PAD

![images/CodePadCircuit](images/CodePadCircuit.png)

Here is a simple CODE PAD to add to your alarm. It consists of 10 buttons and
they must be pressed in a certain order for the output to change. You can see
from the circuit how the buttons are pressed and two buttons must be pressed at
the same time, the two other buttons at the same time,

to gain entry. The operation of this type of pad is very unusual as anyone
pressing the buttons by incrementing numbers will not be able to produce the
code.

## SIGNAL INJECTOR

![images/SignalInjector](images/SignalInjector.png)

This circuit is rich in harmonics and is ideal for testing amplifier circuits.
To find a fault in an amplifier, connect the earth clip to the 0v rail and move
through each stage, starting at the speaker. An increase in volume should be
heard at each preceding stage. This Injector will also go through the IF stages
of radios and FM sound sections in TV's.

## LIGHT ALARM 1

![images/LightAlarm-1](images/LightAlarm-1.png)

This circuit operates when the Light Dependent Resistor receives light.  When
no light falls on the LDR, its resistance is high and the transistor driving
the speaker is not turned on.

When light falls on the LDR its resistance decreases and the collector of the
second transistor falls. This turns off the first transistor slightly via the
second 100n and the first 100n puts an additional spike into the base of the
second transistor. This continues until the second transistor is turned on as
hard as it can go. The first 100n is now nearly charged and it cannot keep the
second transistor turned on. The second transistor starts to turn off and both
transistors swap conditions to produce the second half of the cycle.

## LIGHT ALARM 2

![images/LightAlarm-2](images/LightAlarm-2.png)

This circuit is similar to Light Alarm -1 but produces a louder output due to
the speaker being connected directly to the circuit.

The circuit is basically a high-gain amplifier that is turned on initially by
the LDR and then the 10n keeps the circuit turning on until it can turn on no
more.  The circuit then starts to turn off and eventually turns off completely.
The current through the LDR starts the cycle again.

## LIGHT ALARM 3 (MOVEMENT DETECTOR)

![images/LightAlarm-3](images/LightAlarm-3.png)

This circuit is very sensitive and can be placed in a room to detect the
movement of a person up to 2 metres from the unit.

The circuit is basically a high-gain amplifier (made up of the first three
transistors) that is turned on by the LDR or photo Darlington transistor. The

third transistor charges the 100u via a diode and this delivers turn-on voltage
for the oscillator.  The LDR has equal sensitivity to the photo transistor in
this circuit.

## SOUND TRIGGERED LED

![images/SoundTriggeredLED](images/SoundTriggeredLED.png)

This circuit turns on a LED when the microphone detects a loud sound.  The
"charge-pump" section consists of the 100n, 10k, signal diode and 10u
electrolytic. A signal on the collector of the first transistor is passed to
the 10u via the diode and this turns on the second transistor, to illuminate
the LED.

## SIMPLE LOGIC PROBE

![images/SimpleLogicProbe](images/SimpleLogicProbe.png)

This circuit consumes no current when the probe is not touching any circuitry.
The reason is the voltage across the green LED, the base-emitter junction of
the BC557, plus the voltage across the red LED and base-emitter junction of the
BC547 is approx: 2.1v + 0.6v + 1.7v + 0.6v = 5v and this is greater than the
supply voltage.

When the circuit detects a LOW, the BC557 is turned on and the green LED
illuminates. When a HIGH (above 2.3v) is detected, the red LED is illuminated.

## SIMPLE LOGIC PROBE with PULSE

![images/SimpleLogicProbeWithPulse](images/SimpleLogicProbeWithPulse.png)

This circuit consumes no current when the probe is not touching any circuitry
and the input has a surprisingly HIGH IMPEDANCE.

Keep the probe away from stray signals (especially mains hum) as the orange LED
will illuminate.

When the red LED illuminates, the HIGH is passed through the 1N4148 diode and
the third transistor is an emitter-follower. It increases the
current-capability of the pulse and charges a 2u2. The 4th transistor increases
the capacity of the 2u2 by about 100 times to make it a 220u electro to keep
the orange LED illuminated for a few milliseconds after the pulse has ceased.
The voltage-drop across the diode and base-emitter junctions of the transistors
reduces the voltage on the emitter of the 4th transistor to less than 1v and an
extra 1.5v is needed from the supply to illuminate the orange LED.

## LOGIC PROBE with PULSE

![images/LogicProbeWithPulse-1](images/LogicProbeWithPulse-1.png)

This circuit has the advantage of providing a PULSE LED to show when a logic
level is HIGH and pulsing at the same time. It can be built for less than $5.00
on a piece of matrix board or on a small strip of copper clad board if you are
using surface mount components. The probe will detect a HIGH at 3v and thus the
project can be used for 3v, 5v and CMOS circuits.

## CONTINUITY TESTER

![images/ContinuityTester](images/ContinuityTester.png)

This circuit has the advantage of providing a beep when a short-circuit is
detected but does not detect the small voltage drop across a diode. This is
ideal when testing logic circuits as it is quick and you can listen for the
beep while concentrating on the probe. Using a multimeter is much slower.

## TRAIN THROTTLE

![images/TrainThrottle](images/TrainThrottle.png)

This circuit is for model train enthusiasts. By adding this circuit to your
speed controller box, you will be able to simulate a train starting slowly from
rest.

Remove the wire-wound rheostat and replace it with a 1k pot. This controls the
base of the BC547 and the 2N3055 output is controlled by the BC547. The diodes
protect the transistors from reverse polarity from the input and spikes from
the rails.

## GUITAR FUZZ

![images/Fuzz](images/Fuzz.png)

The output of a guitar is connected to the input of the Fuzz circuit. The
output of this circuit is connected to the input of your amplifier.  With the
guitar at full volume, this circuit is overdriven and distorts. The distorted
signal is then clipped by the diodes and your power amp amplifies the Fuzz
effect.

## STRENGTH TESTER

![images/StrengthTester](images/StrengthTester.png)

This is a simple "staircase" circuit in which the LEDs come on as the
resistance between the probes decreases.

When the voltage on the base of the first transistor sees 0.6v + 0.6v + 0.6v =
1.8v, LED1 comes on. LEDs 1&2 will come on when the voltage rises a further
0.6v. The amount of pressure needed on the probes to produce a result, depends
on the setting of the 200k pot.

## FOG HORN

![images/FogHorn](images/FogHorn.png)

When the push-button is pressed, the 100u will take time to charge and this
will provide the rising pitch and volume. When the push-button is released, the
level and pitch will die away. This is the characteristic sound of a ship's fog
horn.

## HEADS OR TAILS

![images/HeadsOrTails](images/HeadsOrTails.png)

When the push-button is pressed, the circuit will oscillate at a high rate and
both LEDs will illuminate. When the push button is released, one of the LEDs
will remain illuminated. The 50k is designed to equalise the slightly different
values on each half of the circuit and prevent a "bias."

## ROBOT MAN

![images/RobotManAnim](images/RobotManCct.png)

This multivibrator circuit will flash the Robot Man's eyes as shown in the
photo. The kit of components is available from Talking Electronics for $8.50
plus postage. Send an email to find out the cost of postage: talking@tpg.com.au

## DYNAMIC MICROPHONE AMPLIFIER

![images/DynamicMicAmp](images/DynamicMicAmp.png)

This circuit takes the place of an electret microphone. It turns an ordinary
mini speaker into a very sensitive microphone.

Any NPN transistors such as BC 547 can be used. The circuit will work from 3v
to 9v. It is a common-base amplifier and accepts the low impedance of the
speaker to produce a gain of more than 100.

## DYNAMIC MICROPHONE AMPLIFIER-2

![images/DynamicMicAmp-2](images/DynamicMicAmp-2.png)

This circuit is a BOOTSTRAP design. It turns an ordinary mini speaker into a
very sensitive microphone.

Any NPN transistors such as BC 547 can be used. The circuit will work from 6v
to 12v. It has been taken from our Stereo VU Meter project.

## SCR WITH TRANSISTORS

![images/SCRwithTrs](images/SCRwithTrs.png)

The SCR in circuit A produces a 'LATCH.' When the button is pressed, the LED
remains illuminated.

The SCR can be replaced with two transistors as shown in circuit B.

To turn off circuit A, the current through the SCR is reduced to zero by the
action of the OFF button. In circuit B the OFF button removes the voltage on
the base of the BC547. The OFF button could be placed across the two
transistors and the circuit will turn off.

## HEE HAW SIREN

![images/HeeHawSiren](images/HeeHawSiren.png)

The circuit consists of two multivibrators. The first multi-vibrator operates
at a low frequency and this provides the speed of the change from Hee to Haw.
It modifies the voltage to the tone multivibrator, by firstly allowing full
voltage to appear at the bottom of the 220R and then a slightly lower voltage
when the LED is illuminated.

## MICROPHONE PRE-AMPLIFIER

![images/MicPreAmp](images/MicPreAmp.png)

This circuit consists of two directly coupled transistors operating as
common-emitter amplifiers.

The ratio of the 10k resistor to the 100R sets the gain of the circuit at 100.

## HARTLEY OSCILLATOR

![images/HartleyOsc](images/HartleyOsc.png)

The Hartley Oscillator is characterised by an LC circuit in its collector. The
base of the transistor is held steady and a small amount of signal is taken
from a tapping on the inductor and fed to the emitter to keep the transistor in
oscillation.

The transformer can be any speaker transformer with centre-tapped primary.

The frequency is adjusted by changing the 470p.

## COLPITTS OSCILLATOR

![images/ColpittsOsc](images/ColpittsOsc.png)

The Colpitts Oscillator is characterised by tapping the mid-point of the
capacitive side of the oscillator section. The inductor can be the primary side
of a speaker transformer. The feedback comes via the inductor.

## PHASESHIFT OSCILLATOR

![images/PhaseshiftOsc](images/PhaseshiftOsc.png)

The Phaseshift Oscillator is characterised by 3 high-pass filters, creating a
180° phase shift.

The output is a sinewave. Take care not to load the output - this will prevent
reliable start-up and may stop the circuit from oscillating.

Reduced the 3k3 load resistor if the load prevents the circuit oscillating. See
Phase Shift Oscillator in second section of 200 Transistor Circuits for a
better design.

## DOOR-KNOB ALARM

![images/DoorKnobAlarm](images/DoorKnobAlarm.png)

This circuit can be used to detect when someone touches the handle of a door. A
loop of bare wire is connected to the point "touch plate" and the project is
hung on the door-knob. Anyone touching the metal door-knob will kill the pulses
going to the second transistor and it will turn off. This will activate the
"high-gain" amplifier/oscillator.

The circuit will also work as a "Touch Plate" as it does not rely on mains hum,
as many other circuits do.

## SIMPLE MOTOR SPEED CONTROL

![images/MotorSpeedControl](images/MotorSpeedControl.png)

This circuit is better than reducing the RPM of a motor via a resistor. Firstly
it is more efficient. And secondly it gives the motor a set of pulses and this
allows it to start at low RPM.

It's a simple Pulse-Width circuit or Pulse-Circuit.

## MOTOR SPEED CONTROLLER

![images/MotorSpeedController](images/MotorSpeedController.png)

Most simple motor speed controllers simply reduce the voltage to a motor by
introducing a series resistance. This reduces the motor's torque and if the
motor is stopped, it will not start again.

This circuit detects the pulses of noise produced by the motor to turn the
circuit off slightly. If the motor becomes loaded, the amplitude of the pulses
decreases and the circuit turns on more to deliver a higher current.

## MOTOR SPEED CONTROL - Circuit 3

![images/MotorSpeedController-2](images/MotorSpeedController-2.png)

## ELECTRONIC DRUMS

![images/Electronics-Drums](images/Electronics-Drums.png)

The circuit consists of two "twin-T" oscillators set to a point below
oscillation. Touching a Touch Pad will set the circuit into oscillation.
Different effects are produced by touching the pads in different ways and a
whole range of effects are available.

The two 25k pots are adjusted to a point just before oscillation.

A "drum roll" can be produced by shifting a finger rapidly across adjacent
ground and drum pads.

## LIGHT EXTENDER

![images/LightExtender](images/LightExtender.png)

This circuit is a Courtesy Light Extender for cars. It extends the "ON" time
when a door is closed in a car, so the passenger can see where he/she is
sitting.

When the door switch is opened, the light normally goes off immediately, but
the circuit takes over and allows current to flow because the 22u is not
charged and the first BC 547 transistor is not turned ON. This turns on the
second BC547 via the 100k and the BD679 is also turned on to illuminate the
interior light.

The 22u gradually charges via the 1M and the first BC547 turns on, robbing the
second BC547 of "turn-on" voltage and it starts to turn off the BD679.

The 1N4148 discharges the 22u when the door is opened. A 2k2 may needed to be
added to completely turn off the globe.

## LIGHT EXTENDER MkII

![images/LightExtender-2](images/LightExtender-2.png)

This circuit is a simpler Courtesy Light Extender for cars. It extends the "ON"
time when a door is closed in a car. Both circuits perform exactly the same.
This circuit is slightly simpler.

It uses only a single BC557 and BD679 transistor.

## 20 WATT FLUORO INVERTER

![images/20wFluoro-Inverter](images/20wFluoro-Inverter.png)

This circuit will drive a 40 watt fluoro or two 20-watt tubes in series.  The
transformer is wound on a ferrite rod 10mm dia and 8cm long.

The wire diameters are not critical but our prototype used 0.61mm wire for the
primary and 0.28mm wire for the secondary and feedback winding.

Do not remove the tube when the circuit is operating as the spikes produced by
the transformer will damage the transistor.

The circuit will take approx 1.5amp on 12v, making it more efficient than
running the tubes from the mains. A normal fluoro takes 20 watts for the tube
and about 15 watts for the ballast.

A Kit for this project is available from Talking Electronics called Fluorescent
Lamp Inverter for $12.50 plus postage. Click [HERE](mailto:talking@tpg.com.au?Subject=Buying Fluorescent Lamp Inverter kit for $12.50 plus postage&amp;Body=Please e-mail the cost of sending Fluorescent Lamp Inverter Kit by air mail to my country:___________________  and send details of how I can pay for it. My name is:________)

## 6 to 12 WATT FLUORO INVERTER

![images/6-12wFluoro-Inverter](images/6-12wFluoro-Inverter.png)

This circuit will drive a 40 watt fluoro or two 20-watt tubes in series but
with less brightness than the circuit above and it will take less current.

2 x 20 watt tubes = 900mA to 1.2A

and 1 x 20 watt tube 450mA to 900mA depending on pot setting.

The transformer is wound on a ferrite rod 10mm dia and 8cm long. The wire
diameter is fairly critical and our prototype used 0.28mm wire for all the
windings.

Do not remove the tube when the circuit is operating as the spikes produced by
the transformer will damage the transistor. The pot will adjust the brightness
and vary the current consumption. Adjust the pot and select the base-bias
resistor to get the same current as our prototype. Heat-sink must be greater
than 40sq cm. Use heat-sink compound.

This very simple circuit will detect gold or metal or coins at a distance of
approx 20cm - depending on the size of the object.

The circuit oscillates at approx 140kHz and a harmonic of this frequency is
detected by an AM radio.  Simply tune the radio until a squeal is detected.

When the search coil is placed near a metal object, the frequency of the
circuit will change and this will be heard from the speaker.

The layout of the circuit is shown and the placement of the radio.

The TRUTH about Metal (GOLD) Detectors.

A Gold Detector's club in the US created a challenge with 12 members with
skills ranging from 12 months detection to over 25 years. They used 5 different
detectors to find 30 different items, hidden in sand and under pieces of
cardboard.

The results were these: all detectors performed almost equally but the
interpretation of the beeps, sounds and readings on the detector were quite
often mis-read and the winner was a member with 1 year experience.  The moral
of the story is to dig for anything that is detected as it may not be a
"ring-pull."

With these findings you can clearly use a very simple, cheap, detector and get
results equal to the most expensive equipment.  The only thing you have to
remember is this: You need the right frequency for the type of soil to cancel
out the effects of minerals etc.

That's why there is a range of frequencies from 6kHz to 150Hz.

All the other modes of producing and injecting the pulse add only a very small
improvement to the detection process.

The energy put into the injecting pulse also has an influence of the depth of
detection.

Buying Metal Detector kit: Even though this circuit is the simplest you can
get, it performs just like the $50.00 metal detectors because you use an
ordinary AM radio to produce the tone. It will detect a small coin at 10cm.

## METAL DETECTOR MkII

![MetalDetectorMkIICct](images/MetalDetectorMkIICct-bw.png)

This is a self-contained metal detector with about the same performance as
Metal Detector-1 above.

All Metal detectors having the principle of detecting a metal object with a
coil of about 12cm dia and operating at 100kHz, will have the same performance,
no matter how complex the circuit.

They all rely on detecting the change in frequency as small as 1Hz or a
voltage-change across a coil as small as 1uV.

The secret is to produce the largest waveform while loading the coil as lightly
as possible. This allows the coil to detect metal at the furthest distance. See
more details on Metal Detector MkII Nail Finder - see the full project: Metal

## PHASER GUN

![PhaserGun](images/PhaserGun.png)

This is a very effective circuit. The sound is amazing. You have to build it to
appreciate the range of effects it produces. The 50k pot provides the frequency
of the sound while the switch provides fast or slow speed.

[Hear the sounds (built by a reader).](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN_fBZxRpoU&feature=BFa&list=UU2oJeVi1pM3nQy_8X6fFHAA)

## IC RADIO

![ICradio](images/ICradio.png)

This circuit contains an IC but it looks like a 3-leaded transistor and that's
why we have included it here.

The IC is called a "Radio in a Chip" and it contains 10 transistors to produce
a TRF (tuned Radio Frequency) front end for our project.

The 3-transistor amplifier is taken from our [SUPER EAR] project with the
electret microphone removed.

The two 1N 4148 diodes produce a constant voltage of 1.3v for the chip as it is
designed for a maximum of 1.5v.

The "antenna coil" is 60t of 0.25mm wire wound on a 10mm ferrite rod. The
tuning capacitor can be any value up to 450p.

Note: The YS414 IC is identical to ZN414. See above.

## 5-TRANSISTOR RADIO

![5-TrRadio](images/5-TrRadio.png)

If you are not able to get the ZN414 IC, this circuit uses two transistors to
take the place of the chip.

## AUTOMATIC LIGHT

![AutomaticLight](images/AutomaticLight.png)

This circuit automatically turns on a light when illumination is removed from
the LDR. It remains ON for the delay period set by the 2M2 pot.

The important feature of this circuit is the building blocks it contains - a
delay circuit and Schmitt Trigger. These can be used when designing other
circuits.

## NIGHT LIGHT

![NightLight](images/NightLight.png)

This circuit activates a relay when illumination falls below a preset level on
the Light Dependent Resistor (Photo Cell).

![NightLight-2](images/NightLight-2.png)

This circuit will drive 30cm strips to 5m strips. Two 5m strips have been
tested with this circuit.

## PIR LED LIGHT

PIR detectors make a wonderful detector to turn on LEDs to illuminate a
passage, doorway or path.

It has an LDR that only allows the circuit to turn ON at night.

![PIR-LED-Light](images/PIR-LED-Light.png)

This circuit can use old cells as it requires less than 20mA to
illuminate the 4 LEDs and less than 0.4mA when sitting around.

There are a number of different PIR detectors and most of them take 1 minute to
settle before detecting IR and turn ON for a short period of time. The 100u
increases the turn-ON time to about 4 seconds and some detectors keep
outputting a signal while you are in front of the lens.

The first transistor increases the current from the PIR module so the 100u can
be charged via the 1k and the second transistor acts as a buffer to deliver
current to turn on the LEDs.  The 100R and red 100u prevent the PIR
re-triggering.

This is a great project for "using up" old batteries.

A kit for this project is available from Talking Electronics for $6.00 plus
$4.50 postage.

It is built on a small piece of Matrix Board and includes 4 x super-bright
LEDs. Email Colin Mitchell for details.

## PIR LED LIGHT using LED STRIP

![PIR-LED-LightwithTx](images/PIR-LED-LightwithTx.png)

This circuit uses a home-made transformer, wound on a nut and bolt, and a 12v
LED Strip or LED Panel.

You can use almost any nut and bolt and any wire from 0.2mm to 0.5mm diameter.

The main winding has 100 turns and the feedback winding has 30 turns.

All these LED panels have inbuilt resistors so they can be connected to 12v
supplies. We do not need the inbuilt resistors in this circuit however the
resistors cannot be removed.  The LED strip shown in the circuit above contains
9 LEDs in groups of 3 with an inbuilt current liming resistor. The
current-limiting resistor is not needed in this design but cannot be removed.

You can make your own LED strip by connecting three white LEDs in series (NO
current-limiting resistor is needed). You can have a total of 9 LEDs. (3
strings of 3 LEDs) or you can use any of the 12v LED panels available on eBay.

If the circuit does not work, connect the feedback wires around the other way.

The LDR is included to turn the circuit ON only at night and the
emitter-follower transistor increases the ON-time to about 4 seconds.

You can use old cells and make sure the supply is not higher than 9v as the LED
Strip will remain illuminated because you will be supplying enough voltage to
illuminate it !!  You will need to experiment with the 2k2 resistor and 2n2 to
get the best illumination with the transformer you use and the supply voltage.

## 3-LED CHASER by Faraday (s.sh_butterfly@yahoo.com)

![3-LED-Chaser](images/3-LED-Chaser.png)

The LEDs in this circuit produce a chasing pattern similar the running LEDs
display in video shops.

In fact the effect is called: "Running Hole." All transistors will try to come
on at the same time when the power is applied, but some will be faster due to
their internal characteristics and some will get a different turn-on current
due to the exact value of the 22u electrolytics. The last 22u will delay the
voltage-rise to the base of the first transistor and make the circuit start
reliably. It is very difficult to see where the hole starts and that's why you
should build the circuit and investigate it yourself. The circuit can be
extended to any number of odd stages as shown in the next circuit, using 5
transistors.

## 5-LED CHASER

![5-LED-Chaser](images/5-LED-Chaser.png)

This is an extension of the 3-LED Chaser above.

The following circuit produces a slightly different effect because the LEDs are
in the emitter. You cannot mix the LED colours.

## 3-LED CHASER using FETs

![3-ChaserWithFETs](images/3-ChaserWithFETs.png)

This circuit uses FETs. This circuit has been tested with the following two
FETs on 6v to 12v with red and white LEDs. The 1M resistor must be reduced to
47k for the 2N7000. Note the different pin-outs for the two FETs.

## BENCH POWER SUPPLY

![BenchPwrSuply](images/BenchPwrSuply.png)

This power supply can be built in less than an hour on a piece of
copper-laminate. The board acts as a heat-sink and the other components can be
mounted as shown in the photo, by cutting strips to suit their placement.  The
components are connected with enamelled wire and the transistor is bolted to
the board to keep it cool.

The Bench Power Supply was designed to use old "C","D" and lantern batteries,
that's why there are no diodes or electrolytics.  Collect all your old
batteries and cells and connect them together to get at least 12v -14v.

The output of this power supply is regulated by a 10v zener made up of the
characteristic zener voltage of 8.2v between the base-emitter leads of a BC547
transistor (in reverse bias) and approx 1.7v across a red LED. The circuit will
deliver 0v - 9v at 500mA (depending on the life left in the cells your are
using). The 10k pot adjusts the output voltage and the LED indicates the
circuit is ON. It's a very good circuit to get the last of the energy from old
cells.

## ADDING A VOLT-METER TO THE BENCH POWER SUPPLY

A voltmeter can be added to the Bench Power Supply by using a very low cost
multimeter. For less than $10.00 you can get a mini multimeter with 14 ranges,
including a 10v range. The multimeter can also be used to monitor current by
removing the negative lead and making a new RED lead, fitting it to the "—" of
the multimeter and selecting the 500mA range as shown in the photo below:

## MAKING 0-1Amp meter for the BENCH POWER SUPPLY

The item in the photo is called a "Movement." A movement is a moving coil with
a pointer and no resistors connected to the leads.

Any Movement can be converted to an ammeter without any mathematics.

Simply solder two 1R resistors (in parallel) across the terminals of any
movement and connect it in series with an ammeter on the output of the Bench
Power Supply. The second ammeter provides a reference so you can calibrate the
movement. Connect a globe and increase the voltage.

At 500mA, if the pointer is "up scale" (reading too high) add a trim-resistor.
In our case it was 4R7.

The three shunt resistors can be clearly seen in the photo. Two 1R and the trim
resistor is 4R7.

You can get a movement from an old multimeter or they are available in
electronics shops as a separate item. The sensitivity does not matter. It can
be 20uA or 50uA FSD or any sensitivity.

## MAKING A ZENER DIODE and POWER ZENER

![ZenerVoltages](images/ZenerVoltages.png)

Sometimes a zener diode of the required voltage is not available. Here are a
number of components that produce a characteristic voltage across them. Since
they all have different voltages, they can be placed in series to produce the
voltage you need. A reference voltage as low as 0.65v is available and you need
at least 1 to 3mA through the device(s) to put them in a state of conduction
(breakdown).

![PowerZener](images/PowerZener.png)

A POWER ZENER can be made from an ordinary zener and a transistor. The final
power-zener voltage will be 0.6v higher than the zener and the wattage of
the whole circuit will depend on the type of transistor used.  Of course,
constant use of this circuit will represent a waste of 20 watts and there are
better ways to design a circuit, but it can be used to prevent a rail rising
above a certain voltage and will only be used for short durations.

## 12v TRICKLE CHARGER

![12vTrickleCharger](images/12vTrickleCharger.png)

The 12v Trickle Charger circuit uses a TIP3055 power transistor to limit the
current to the battery by turning off when the battery voltage reaches approx
14v or if the current rises above 2 amp. The signal to turn off this transistor
comes from two other transistors - the BC557 and BC 547.

Firstly, the circuit turns on fully via the BD139 and TIP3055. The BC557 and BC
547 do not come into operation at the moment. The current through the 0.47R
creates a voltage across it to charge the 22u and this puts a voltage between
the base and emitter of the BC547. The transistors turn on slightly and remove
some of the turn-on voltage to the BD139 and this turns off the TIP3055
slightly.

This is how the 2 amp max is created.

As the battery voltage rises, the voltage divider made up of the 1k8 and 39k
creates a 0.65v between base and emitter of the BC557 and it starts to turn on
at approx 14v. This turns on the BC 547 and it robs the BD136 of "turn-on"
voltage and the TIP3055 is nearly fully turned off.  All battery chargers in
Australia must be earthed. The negative of the output is taken to the earth
pin.

## 1.5v to 10v INVERTER

![1v5 to 10v Inverter](images/1v5to9vInverter.png)

This very clever circuit will convert 1.5v to 10v to take the place of those
expensive 9v batteries and also provide a 5v supply for a microcontroller
project.

But the clever part is the voltage regulating section. It reduces the current
to less than 8mA when no current is being drawn from the output. With a 470R
load and 10v, the output current is 20mA and the voltage drop is less than
10mV. The pot will adjust the output voltage from 5.3v to 10v. 

### How the Circuit Works 

The circuit starts by the 100k turning on the BC547 and the BC557 gets turned
ON via the 33k resistor.

This turns ON the BC337 via the 100R resistor. You will notice the
"current-limiting" resistors are getting small and smaller. This is because
the transistor-current is getting larger and larger and we want the resistor to
pass this higher current.

Current flowing through the collector-base of the BC337 causes current to flow
through the inductor. This current creates expanding flux that cuts all the
turns of the inductor and produces a voltage in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION. This
voltage OPPOSES the incoming voltage and very little current flows.

Over a period of microseconds, this voltage drops a microscopic amount and thus
a slightly higher current will flow.

The voltage on the collector drops and this change is passed through the 330p
to turn on the BC557 MORE.

This continues until the BC337 is fully turned ON (by the action of the 330p).

The 330p now charges a little more and this reduces the base current in the
BC557 and it starts to turn OFF.

This action starts to turn OFF the BC337 and very soon we have both transistors
fully turned OFF.

The BC337 is effectively removed from the circuit and the current flowing
through the inductor stops increasing. The magnetic flux stops increasing and
the voltage it produces stops IMMEDIATELY.

The magnetic flux now does not have any voltage opposing it and it starts to
collapse and cut all the turns of the inductor. It does this very quickly
because there is no voltage opposing its collapse.

The result is a very high voltage in the opposite direction to the applied
voltage. What this means is the lower terminal of the inductor produces a
voltage that is ADDED to the supply voltage.

This voltage can be as high at 100v or more, and is passed through the diode.
Even though this voltage is very high, it actually consists of a very high
voltage with a very small current.

The combination of these two is called ENERGY and it flows into the 100u to
charge it.

As the voltage on the 100u increases, its voltage is detected by the 4th
transistor and when it reaches 10v, the 3rd transistor is turned OFF slightly
so the first two transistors are not driven as hard.

This is how a stable 10v is produced.

## 5v REGULATED SUPPLY FROM 3V

![5vRegulatedSupply](images/5vRegulatedSupply.png)

This circuit will produce a 5v regulated output from 2 cells (3v). The output
current is limited to 50mA but will be ideal for many microcontroller circuits.
The output voltage is set to 5v by the 3k9 and 560R resistors, making up a
voltage divider network.

## 3.3v FROM 5V SUPPLY

![3.3vSupply](images/3v3_Supply.png)

Here are 3 ways to generate a 3.3v supply: Circuit "A" uses
two 1.5v cells. This is the cheapest and best way to create a 3v supply.

Circuit "B" uses 3 x 1N448 signal diodes to drop 1.8v and produce 3.2v on the
output. The 5v supply must be regulated.  Circuit "C" produces 3.3v from a 3v3
zener. The 47R limits the output to about 30mA. The 5v can have a small ripple
as the zener will create a stable 3v3 output.

## 9v SUPPLY FROM 3V

![9vRegulatedSupply](images/9vRegulatedSupply.png)

You can replace a 9v battery with this circuit.  The output
is about 10.4v on no load and 9.6v @30mA .

The advantage is the voltage stays over 9v for the life of the cells.

A normal 9v battery drops to 7v very quickly.

The output voltage is set to 9-10v by the 6k8 and 390R resistors. The 470R
gives the circuit an idling current of about 20mA and the spikes are about
75mV.

By increasing the 470R, the quiescent current decreases but the voltage drops
more when the current is 30mA.

## 27MHz Field Strength Meter

![27MHzFSM](images/27MHzFSM.png)

This circuit will test 27MHz transmitters and show the transmitter is operating
when the antenna is connected to point 1 and the actual frequency of
transmission when the antenna is connected to point 2.

See the full project [HERE](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Field%20Strength%20Meter/27MHzFieldStrengthMeter.html).

## 27MHz TRANSMITTER

![27MHzTx](images/27MHzTx.png)

The transmitter is a very simple crystal oscillator. The heart of the circuit
is the tuned circuit consisting of the primary of the transformer and a 10p
capacitor. The frequency is adjusted by a ferrite slug in the centre of the
coil until it is exactly the same as the crystal. The transistor is configured
as a common emitter amplifier. It has a 390R on the emitter for biasing
purposes and prevents a high current passing through the transistor as the
resistance of the transformer is very low.

The "pi" network matches the antenna to the output of the circuit. See full
description in [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## 27MHz RECEIVER

![27MHzRx](images/27MHzRx.png)

The 27MHz receiver is really a transmitter. It's a very weak transmitter and
delivers a low level signal to the surroundings via the antenna. When another
signal (from the transmitter) comes in contact with the transmission from the
receiver it creates an interference pattern that reflects down the antenna and
into the first stage of the receiver.

The receiver is a super-regenerative design. It is self-oscillating (or already
oscillating) and makes it very sensitive to nearby signals. See full
description in [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## 27MHz RECEIVER-2

![27MHzRx-2](images/27MHzRx-2.png)

This circuit matches with the 27MHz Transmitter with Square-wave Oscillator.
See full description on Talking Electronics website: [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).  The
receiver frequency is fixed. The transmitter is adjusted to suit the receiver.
The 3-27p trimmer is adjusted for maximum gain (10p trimmer and 5p6 in our
case) and this is a critical adjustment.

The base-emitter junction of the first BC547 sets 0.7v (as it is heavily turned
on by the 10k) on the base of the oscillator Q1, and this is fixed. Q1 is very
lightly turned on (due to the emitter resistor), and this makes it very
sensitive when it is oscillating. Any 27MHz signal from the surroundings will
upset the oscillator and any tone in the signal will be passed to the stages
for amplification. The coil is 13 turns. It can be replaced with 11 turns of
0.25mm wire on 3mm dia slug 7mm long. Although the original Russian product
worked very well, our prototype did not have very good sensitivity. The circuit
was very difficult to set-up.

Note: When making the 27uH inductor and checking its value on an inductance
meter; if the meter does not read low values accurately, put two inductors in
series. Measure the first inductor, say 100uH. The two inductors in series will
be 127uH as inductors combine just like resistors in series!  The result is the
addition of the individual values.

## 27MHz TRANSMITTER WITHOUT A CRYSTAL

![27MHzTx-NoXtal](images/27MHzTx-NoXtal.png)

A 27MHz transmitter without a crystal. When a circuit does not have a crystal,
the oscillator is said to be "voltage dependent" or "voltage controlled" and
when the supply voltage drops, the frequency changes.

If the frequency drifts too much, the receiver will not pick up the signal. For
this reason, a simple circuit as shown is not recommended. We have only
included it as a concept to show how the 27MHz frequency is generated. It
produces a tone and this is detected by a receiver.  See full description in
[27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## 27MHz TRANSMITTER WITH SQUARE-WAVE OSCILLATOR

![27MHzTx-SquarewaveOsc](images/27MHzTx-SquarewaveOsc.png)

The circuit consists of two blocks. Block 1is a multivibrator and this has an
equal mark/space ratio to turn the RF stage on and off. Block 2 is an RF
oscillator. The feedback to keep the stage operating is provided by the 27p
capacitor. The frequency-producing items are the coil (made up of the full 7
turns) and the 47p air trimmer. These two items are called a parallel tuned
circuit. They are also called a TANK CIRCUIT as they store energy just like a
TANK of water and pass it to the antenna. The frequency of the circuit is
adjusted by the 47p air trimmer. See full description in [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## WALKIE TALKIE

![WalkieTalkie-4Tr](images/WalkieTalkie-4Tr.png)

Nearly all the components in the 4-transistor circuit are used for both
transmitting and receiving. This makes it a very economical design. The
frequency-generating stage only needs the crystal to be removed and it becomes
a receiver. Next is a three transistor directly coupled audio amplifier with
very high gain. The first transistor is a pre-amplifier and the next two are
wired as a super-alpha pair, commonly called a Darlington pair to drive the
speaker transformer.

See full description in [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## 27MHz TRANSMITTER - 2 CHANNEL

![27MHzTx-2Ch](images/27MHzTx-2Ch.png)

This circuit does not use a crystal but has a clever feature of using the two
push buttons to turn the circuit on when it is required to transmit.  The
frequency of the multivibrator is determined by the value of resistance on the
base of each transistor. The multivibrator is driven directly from the supply
with the forward button and via a 150k for the reverse frequency.  The receiver
requires a 1kHz tone for forward and 250Hz for reverse.  See full description
in [27MHz Links article](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html).

## 27MHz TRANSMITTER - 4 CHANNEL

![27MHzTx-4Ch](images/27MHzTx-4Ch.png)

This circuit uses the same number of components as the 2-Channel circuit above
but has 4 channels.

The frequency of the multivibrator is determined by the value of resistance on
the base of each transistor.

A 4 channel receiver has been designed by talking Electronics using a PIC12F628
micro to detect the different frequencies.

See P4 of: 2 Digit Up/Down Counter (see left index on Talking Electronics
website).

2 Digit Up/Down Counter has the receiver section.

- A = 500Hz
- B = 550Hz
- C = 660Hz
- D = 1kHz

## 303MHz TRANSMITTER

![303MHzTx](images/303MHzTx.png)

The transmitter circuit is made up of two building blocks - the 303MHz RF
oscillator and the 32kHz crystal controlled oscillator to generate a tone so
the receiver does not false-trigger.

The 303MHz oscillator consists of a self-oscillating circuit made up of the
coil on the PC board and a 9p (9 puff) capacitor.

See full description in [Wireless Doorbell](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/WirelessDoorbell/WirelessDoorbell.html) article.

## BOOM GATE LIGHTS

![BoomGateLights](images/BoomGateLights.png)

This simple circuit will produce flashing lights for your model railway
crossing. It uses one flashing LED and one normal red LED, with a green LED
hidden in the background. It can be used somewhere else on your layout but it
is needed to produce a voltage drop so the two red LEDs will flash.  You cannot
get a simpler circuit.

The second circuit produces the same effect but the flash-rate is more even.

The 1/10th watt resistors used in this circuit, compared with 0.25watt
resistors.

## 5 TRANSISTOR WALKIE TALKIE 1

![WalkieTalkie-5TrCct](images/WalkieTalkie-5TrCct.png)

This walkie talkie circuit does not have a crystal or speaker transformer, with
the board measuring just 3cm x 4cm and using 1/10th watt resistors, it is one
of the smallest units on the market, for just $9.50 to $12.00. The wires in the
photo go to the battery, speaker, call-switch and antenna. The most difficult
component in the circuit to duplicate is the oscillator coil. See the photo for
the size and shape. The coil dia is 5mm and uses 0.25mm wire. The actual
full-turn or half turn on the coil is also important. Almost all 5 transistor
walkie talkies use this circuit or slight variations. See the article: 27MHz
Transmitters for theory on how these transmitters work - it is fascinating.

## 5 TRANSISTOR WALKIE TALKIE 2

![WalkieTalkie-5TrCct-2](images/WalkieTalkie-5TrCct-2.png)

Here is another walkie talkie circuit, using slightly different values for some
of the components.

See the article: [27MHz Transmitters](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/27MHz%20Transmitters/27MHzLinks-1.html) - for theory on how these transmitters work.

## WALKIE TALKIE with LM386

![WalkieTalkieWithLM386](images/WalkieTalkieWithLM386.png)

Here is a more up-to-date version of the walkie talkie, using an LM 386
amplifier IC to take the place of 4 transistors.

## SPY AMPLIFIER

![SpyAmplifier](images/SpyAmplifier.png)

This simple circuit will detect very faint sounds and deliver them to a 32 ohm
earpiece. The circuit is designed for 1.5v operation and is available from
$2.00 shops for less than $5.00

The photo shows the surface-mount components used in its construction.

## HEARING AID 1.5v SUPPLY

![HearingAid1v5](images/HearingAid1v5.png)

This simple circuit will detect very faint sounds and deliver them to an 8 ohm
earpiece. The circuit is designed for 1.5v operation.

## HEARING AID with PUSH PULL OUTPUT

![HearingAidPushPull](images/HearingAidPushPull.png)

This circuit will detect very faint sounds and deliver them to an 8 ohm
earpiece. It is designed for 3v operation.

## HEARING AID with CONSTANT VOLUME

![HearingConstantVolume](images/HearingConstantVolume.png)

This is a very handy circuit as it provides constant volume.

It is designed for 3v operation.

## SOLAR ENGINE

![SolarEngine](images/SolarEngine.png)

This circuit is called Type-1 SE. Low current from a solar cell is stored in a
large capacitor and when a preset voltage-level is reached, the energy from the
capacitor is released to a motor.  For full details on how the circuit works
and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page2.html>

## SUN EATER-I

![SunEater-1](images/SunEater-1.png)

An improved design over Solar Engine circuit above. It has a clever
2-transistor self-latching arrangement to keep the circuit ON until the voltage
drops to 1.5v. The circuit turns on at 2.8v. This gives the motor more energy
from the electrolytic at each "pulse." For full details on how the circuit
works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page2.html>


## SUN EATER-1A

![SunEater-1A](images/SunEater-1A.png)

This circuit is an improvement on the Sun Eater I shown above. It works exactly
the same except the slight re-arrangement of the components allows an NPN power
transistor to be used. One less resistor is needed and one less capacitor but
two extra diodes have been added to increase the upper turn-on voltage.

For full details on how the circuit works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page2.html>

## SOLAR ENGINE Type-3

![SolarEngine-Type3](images/SolarEngine-Type3.png)

Type-3 circuits are current controlled or current-triggered. This is another
very clever way of detecting when the electrolytic has reached its maximum
charge.

At the beginning of the charge-cycle for an electrolytic, the charging current
is a maximum. As the electrolytic becomes charged, the current drops. In the
type-3 circuit, the charging current passes through a 100R resistor and creates
a voltage drop. This voltage is detected by a transistor (Q2) and the
transistor is turned ON.

This action robs transistor (Q1) from turn-on voltage and the rest of the
circuit is not activated. As the charging current drops, Q2 is gradually turned
off and Q1 becomes turned on via the 220k resistor on the base.

This turns on Q3 and the motor is activated. The voltage across the storage
electrolytic drops and the current through the 100R rises and turns the circuit
off. The electrolytic begins to charge again and the cycle repeats. For full
details on how the circuit works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page2.html>

## SOLAR PHOTOVORE

![SolarPhotovore](images/SolarPhotovore.png)

The green LEDs cause the Solar Engine on the opposite side to fire and the
Solar Photovore turns toward the light source. The motors are two pager "vibe"
motors with the weights removed.

The 100k pot on the "head" balances the two Solar Engines. If you cannot get
the circuit to work with green LEDs, use photo-transistors.

For full details on how the circuit works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page4.html>

## FRED Photopopper (Flashing LED)

![Fred-Photo](images/Fred.png)

It is a Photopopper using low-cost components. It uses two red or green
flashing LEDs to turn the circuit on when the voltage across the electrolytic
has reached about 2.7v. The flashing LEDs change characteristics according to
the level of the surrounding light and this turns the circuit into phototropic.

For full details on how the circuit works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page6.html>

## ROBO ROLLER

![RoboRoller](images/RoboRoller.png)

The circuit consists of two building blocks. The Photopopper circuit and a
voltage multiplying (or voltage increasing) circuit from a Solar Charger
project.

For full details on how the circuit works and how to modify it, see:
<http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Robots/Page7.html>

## SIGNAL BY-PASS

![SignalByPass](images/SignalByPass.png)

This circuit allows a class-A amplifier to drive a low impedance speaker and
has a low quiescent current. The 220R in series with the speaker limits the
"wasted" current to about 20mA max as the transistor is generally biased at
mid-voltage. However the transistor will be almost directly driving the speaker
when a signal is being processed and the only limitation is the ability of the
220R to discharge the 100u during each cycle.

The circuit is called a signal by-pass as the signal by-passes the 220R and
drives the speaker directly (via the 100u).

## SOUND-TO-LIGHT

![SoundToLight](images/SoundToLight.png)

The LED illuminates when the piezo diaphragm detects sound.

Some piezo diaphragms are very sensitive and produce 100mV when whistling at
50cm. Others produce 1mV. You must test them with a CRO.

The sensitivity of the diaphragm will determine the sensitivity of the circuit.

The following circuit uses an electret microphone:

![SoundToLight-2](images/SoundToLight-2.png)

## CLAP SWITCH

![SoundToLightWithDelay](images/SoundToLightWithDelay.png)

see also VOX.

### SOUND-TO-LIGHT with Delay

By re-arranging the components slightly from the previous circuit, we create a
15 second illumination of the LED. It will be illuminated with the clap of the
hands.

![ClapSw-2](images/ClapSw-2.png)

The quiescent current is about 20uA, allowing 4 AA cells to last a long time.

The circuit takes about 20 seconds to reset after the LED goes out. The 100u
discharges through the 27k, 100k and 10k resistors.  The circuit can also be
designed to accept an electret microphone:

## CLAP SWITCH "ON-OFF"

![ClapSwitch](images/ClapSwitch.png)

This circuit turns the LED ON with a clap or short whistle. And a further clap
turns it OFF. It uses a speaker as a microphone and the fourth output of the
4017 is used to reset the chip. The 100u on pin 2 upsets the amplifier and
prevents it clocking the chip, until the electro either charges or discharges.
A buffer transistor can replace the LED to operate a relay. It only requires
2mV signal to activate the circuit.

Above: A 3.5mm switched stereo plug and socket wiring.

## MUSIC-TO-COLOUR

![MusicToColour-1](images/MusicToColour-1.png)

The LED illuminates when the circuit detects a high amplitude waveform. It can
be connected to a "Walkman" or mini radio with earphones. A second channel can
be connected to produce a stereo effect. Circuit A consumes less current as the
LED is off when no audio is detected. Circuit B pulses the LED brighter when
audio is detected.

## CABLE TRACER

Why pay $100 for a cable tracer when you can build one for less than $10.00!
This type of tracer is used by telephone technicians, electricians and anyone
laying, replacing or wiring anything, using long cables, such as intercoms,
television or security.

Our cable tracer consists of two units. One unit has a multivibrator with an
output of 4v p-p at approx 5kHz. This is called the transmitter.

![CableTracerTx-Cct](images/CableTracerTx-Cct.png)

<!-- full -->![CableTracer-Tx](images/CableTracer-Tx.jpg)

<!-- full -->![CableTracer-TxPCB-1](images/CableTracer-TxPCB-1.jpg)

The other unit is a very sensitive amplifier with capacitive input for
detecting the tone from the transmitter and a magnetic pickup for detecting
magnetic lines of force from power cables carrying 240v. This is called the
receiver.

![CableTracerRx-Cct](images/CableTracerRx-Cct.png)

<!-- full -->![CableTracer-RxTopView](images/CableTracer-RxTopView.jpg)

<!-- full -->![CableTracer-RxPCB](images/CableTracer-RxPCB.jpg)

The circuit also has an inductive loop, made up of a length of wire,
to pick up stray signals from power cables, so if one detector does not detect
the signal, the other will. Our circuit is nothing like that in the
professional unit shown here:

![CableTracerPhoto](images/CableTracerPhoto.png)

The transmitter is built on a small length of PC board, cut into lands with a
file. The photos clearly show how all the components are mounted and how the
board is fitted into a toothbrush holder. The flashing LED shows the unit is ON
and serves to control the beep-beep-beep of the circuit.  The flashing LED is
not an ordinary LED.

You cannot use an ordinary LED. It must be a FLASHING LED as this type of LED
has a built-in resistor and a chip to make the LED flash.

The circuit does not make the LED flash, the LED makes the circuit
beep-beep-beep due to the on-off from the chip inside the LED.

One constructor used an ordinary LED - and BANG! That's why we are the first in
the world to create a symbol for a flashing LED. The extra bar represents the
chip inside the LED.

The receiver circuit is a high-gain amplifier and produces constant background
noise so the slightest magnetic field can be detected. The 10mH choke can be
any value but the largest number of turns on the core is best.

The mini speaker can be a 16R earpiece but these are not as loud as a mini
speaker.

Quiescent current is 50mA so the on-off switch can be a push-button.

## LED TORCH with 1.5v SUPPLY

Also see [BLOCKING OSCILLATOR also called FLYBACK OSCILLATOR] - the same circuit.

![images/LEDTorchCctB.png](images/LEDTorchCctB.png)

This simple circuit will illuminate a super-bright white LED to full brightness
with 28mA from a 1.5v cell. The LED is 20,000mcd (20cd  @ 15° viewing angle)
and has an output of approx 1lumen.

The transformer is wound on a small ferrite slug 2.6mm dia and 6mm long. It is
made from F29 ferrite material as the circuit operates at a high frequency
(100kHz to 500kHz).

The efficiency of the circuit revolves around the fact that a LED will produce
a very high output when delivered pulses, but the overall current will be less
than a steady DC current.

BC 337 has a collector-emitter voltage of 45v. (BC338 has 25v collector-emitter
voltage rating.) The voltage across the transistor is no more than 4v as the
LED absorbs the spikes. Do not remove the LED as the spikes from the
transformer will damage the transistor.

The circuit will drive 1 or 2 while LEDs in series.

## WHITE LED FLASHER

![WhiteLEDFlasher](images/WhiteLEDFlasher.png)

This circuit will flash a super-bright white LED from a 1.5v cell.  The
transformer is wound on a small ferrite slug 2.6mm dia and 6mm long as shown in
a project above.

The circuit uses the zener characteristic of the reverse-base-emitter junction
of a BC 547 to pass current and flash the LED.

## USING A TOROID INDUCTOR

![Inductor-Toroid](images/Inductor-Toroid.jpg)

Most of our circuits use a ferrite rod and NOT a TOROID.

A toroid is a circular core (sometimes called a doughnut or torus or ring or
annulus) and is actually the most efficient type of ferrite core because none
of the flux is lost to the outside surroundings.

BUT if you use a toroid, you MUST work out the amount of flux you will be
generating when the transistor is turned ON and this will give you the flux
density in the toroid.

But this is a very difficult thing to do.

If you deliver more flux than the toroid can accept, the expanding flux will
not increase at this point in time and the current taken (supplied or
delivered) by the transistor will increase ENORMOUSLY and the transistor will
be DESTROYED.

If you use a ferrite rod, the flux will be lost to the outside air (out the end
of the rod) and the abrupt saturation-point will NOT be generated.

This means a ferrite rod is a much-more "sloppy" or "loose" or "accommodating"
component and is much easier to incorporate into a circuit that has not been
mathematically designed.  If you want to use a toroid, the only way to "design
a circuit" that does not "self-destroy" is to add a lot more turns and
gradually remove a few of the turns while feeling the output transistor for
temperature-rise or measure the current taken by the circuit.

![Inductor-Toroid-2](images/Inductor-Toroid-2.jpg)

Sometimes the number of turns will be reduced to 7 turns plus 7 turns for some
of the circuits driving LEDs in the boost converters shown below.

**Why only 7 turns for a toroid?**

As the transistor turns ON, the 7 turns produces much less flux than 30 turns
and the transistor can turn on for a much longer period of time.

When it is fully turned ON, the core is just at the point of being fully
saturated. At this instant, the flux no-longer expands (increases) and thus the
voltage produced in the feedback winding ceases. This is when the "increasing"
part of the cycle stops, and the "turn-off" part of the cycle starts.

This means the current through the transistor is only a maximum for a very
short period of time.

That's why you have to experiment yourself and it's only when you get the
circuit to work perfectly, that you will LEARN ELECTRONICS.

The workings of an inductor are much more complex than you think.

## 1v5 WHITE LED DRIVER

![1v5 White Led Driver Schematics](images/1v5WhiteLEDDriver.png)

This circuit will drive a super-bright white LED from a 1.5v cell. 

The 60 turn inductor is wound on a small ferrite slug 2.6mm dia and 6mm long
with 0.25mm wire.

The main difference between this circuit and the two circuits above is the use
of a single winding and the feedback to produce oscillation comes from a 1n
capacitor driving a high gain amplifier made up of two transistors.

The feedback is actually positive feedback via the 1n and this turns on the two
transistors more and more until finally they are fully turned on and no more
feedback signal is passed though the 1n. At this point they start to turn off
and the signal through the 1n turns them off more and more until they are fully
turned off.

The 33k turns on the BC557 to start the cycle again.

<!-- full -->![Inductors](images/3-Inductors.jpg)

If you do not have a ferrite slug, the inductor can be made from a machine
screw 10mm long and about 3-4mm dia. Wind 150 turns of 0.25mm wire; or you can
use a brass ferrule 20mm long x 5mm. Wind 150 turns.

**RESULTS** for the same brightness:

- **Slug: 21mA**
- **Brass Spacer: 18mA**
- **Machine screw: 14mA**

**Isn't this a SURPRISE!**

## LED TORCH - 3v Supply

![3v LED TORCH](images/LED-Torch.png)

This circuit will drive up to 3 high-bright white LEDs from a 3v supply. (It will also work from 1.5v)
The inductor consists of 50 turns on a 1.6mm dia ferrite slug using 0.1mm enamelled wire. 
This circuit can use a ready-made 33uH choke, making it suitable for mass production

## LED TORCH with ADJUSTABLE BRIGHTNESS

![LED Torch with Adjustable Brightness Schematics](images/LED-Torch-Cct-AdjBrightness.png)

This circuit will drive up to 3 high-bright white LEDs from a 3v supply. The
circuit has a pot to adjust the brightness to provide optimum brightness for
the current you wish to draw from the battery.

The transformer is wound on a ferrite slug 2.6mm dia and 6mm long as shown in
the LED Torch with 1.5v Supply project. This circuit is a "Boost Converter"
meaning the supply is less than the voltage of the LEDs. If the supply is
greater than the voltage across the LEDs, they will be damaged.

## BUCK CONVERTER for HIGH-POWER LED 48mA to 90mA

![48mA to 90mA](images/BuckConverter90mA.png)

This circuit is a "Buck Converter" meaning the supply is greater than the
voltage of the LED. It will drive 1 high-power white LED from a 12v supply and
is capable of delivering 48mA when R = 5R6 or 90mA when R = 2R2. The LED is
much brighter when using this circuit, compared with a series resistor
delivering the same current. But changing R from 5R6 to 2R2 does not double
the brightness. It only increases it a small amount. The inductor consists of
60 turns of 0.25mm wire, on a 15mm length of ferrite rod, 10mm diameter.
Frequency of operation: approx 1MHz. 

The circuit is not designed to drive one
20mA LED.

This circuit draws the maximum for a BC 338.

## BUCK CONVERTER for HIGH-POWER LED 170mA

![170 mA Buck Converter](images/BuckConverter170mA.png)

This circuit is slightly simpler than above but it does not have the feature of
being able to adjust the drive-current.

The inductor is the same as the photo above but has a feedback winding of 15
turns. Connect the circuit via a 220R resistor and if the LED does not
illuminate, reverse the feedback winding. The driver transistor will need a
small heatsink.

## BUCK CONVERTER for HIGH-POWER LED 210mA

![210 mA converter](images/BuckConverter210mA.png)

This circuit will drive 1 high-power white LED from a 12v supply and is capable
of delivering 210mA.

The driver transistor is BD 139 and the details of the inductor are shown
above.

The voltage across the LED is approx 3.3v - 3.5v The driver transistor will
need a small heatsink. The 2R2 can be increased if a lower drive-current is
required.

## BUCK CONVERTER for HIGH-POWER LED 250mA - 1watt LED

![BuckConverter250mA](images/BuckConverter250mA.png)

This circuit will drive 1watt white LED from a 12v supply and is capable of
delivering 300mA.

The driver transistor is BC 327 and the inductor is 70 turns of 0.25mm wire
wound on the core of a 10mH inductor.

See [Inductor](http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/Inductor/Inductor-1.html)
 to learn how the inductor works.  The voltage across the LED is approx 3.3v -
3.5v The 1R is used to measure the mV across it.

300mV equals 300mA LED current.

The diode MUST be high speed. A non-high-speed diode increases current 50mA!

This circuit is the best design as it does not put peaks of current though the
LED. Reduce 390R slightly to increase maximun current.

## MAKE YOUR OWN 1-WATT LED

![1wattLED](images/1-wattLED.png)

15 LEDs on Matrix board The transformer consists of 50 turns 0.25mm wire
connected to the pins.

The feedback winding is 20 turns 0.095mm wire with "fly-leads."

This circuit drives 15 LEDs to produce the same brightness as a 1-watt LED. The
circuit consumes 750mW but the LEDs are driven with high-frequency,
high-voltage spikes, and become more-efficient and produce a brighter output
that if driven by pure-DC.

The LEDs are connected in 3 strings of 5 LEDs. Each LED has a characteristic
voltage of 3.2v to 3.6v making each chain between 16v and 18v. By selecting the
LEDs we have produced 3 chains of 17.5v

Five LEDs (in a string) has been done to allow the circuit to be powered by a
12v battery and allow the battery to be charged while the LEDs are
illuminating. If only 4 LEDs are in series, the characteristic voltage may be
as low as 12.8v and they may be over-driven when the battery is charging.
(Even-up the characteristic voltage across each chain by checking the total
voltage across them with an 19v supply and 470R dropper resistor.) The
transformer is shown above. It is wound on a 10mH choke with the original
winding removed. This circuit is called a "boost circuit." It is not designed
to drive a single 1-watt LED (a buck circuit is needed).

The LEDs in the circuit are 20,000mcd with a viewing angle of 30 degrees (many
of the LED specifications use "half angle." You have to test a LED to make sure
of the angle).

This equates to approximately 4 lumens per LED. The 4-watt CREE LED claims 160
lumens (or 40 lumens per watt). Our design is between 50 - 60 lumens per watt
and it is a much-cheaper design.

## 18 LEDs using a 3.7v Li-Ion CELL

![18LEDs](images/18LEDs.png)

This circuit drives 18 white LEDs from a 3.7v
Li-Ion cell. It has been designed by Samuel Budiyanto
<budiyantosamuel90@gmail.com> using components from an old Compact Fluorescent
Lamp. No data is available on the 1mH inductor and the circuit has been
provided for experimentation purposes ONLY.

It is an interesting circuit because the two transistors provide a constant
brightness and the BC547 provides feedback to keep the circuit oscillating.

The 10k base resistor seems very high but the circuit has been tested for 12
hours on a 1200mA-Hr cell and the brightness remained constant.  The brightness
is determined by how hard you drive the 2SD882 transistor.  It is turned on by
the 10k resistor and this will deliver very little current, but since the
transistor has a gain of 100 to 300, the collector current will be up to about
100mA.

Basically the circuit will over-drive the LEDs and the BC547 will limit the
current to the required brightness level.

The BC547 transistor has the effect of turning OFF the 2SD at a particular
instant in each cycle to reduce the time when it is turned ON. The BC547 gets
its "timing" from the 10k and 1k resistors, by the fact that these resistors
form a voltage divider to produce a voltage on the base. When the 2SD turns ON,
a voltage is developed across the 10R that adds to this voltage but it is
delayed slightly by the 1n capacitor. The 1n determines the frequency at which
the circuit will oscillate. By experimenting with these 4 components you get
the required brightness and this remains constant for the life of the cell.
All the LEDs are in series on each string and the brightness will depend on
matching each string. By swapping some of the LEDs you will be able to adjust
the brightness to make them all emit equally.

## 1-WATT LED - a very good design

![1-watt LED Driver Schematics](images/1wattLED.png)

**Circuit takes 70mA on LOW brightness and 120mA on HIGH Brightness
see MOD below**
 
Circuit takes 70mA on LOW brightness and 120mA on HIGH Brightness see MOD
below. This circuit has been specially designed for a 6v rechargeable battery
or 5 x 1.2v NiCad cells. **Do not use any other voltage.**

It has many features:

- The pulse-operation to the two 1-watt LEDs delivers a high current for a short
  period of time and this improves the brightness.
- The circuit can drive two 1-watt LEDs with extremely good brightness and this
  makes it more efficient than any other design.

The circuit is a two-transistor high-frequency oscillator and it works like
this:

- The BD139 is turned ON via the base, through the white LED and two signal
  diodes and it amplifies this current to appear though the collector-emitter
  circuit.
- This current flows though the 1-watt LED to turn it ON and also through the
  30-turn winding of the inductor.
- At the same time the current through the 10R creates a voltage-drop and when
  this voltage rises to 0.65v, the BC547 transistor starts to turn ON. This
  robs the base of the BD139 of "turn-on voltage" and the current through the
  inductor ceases to be expanding flux, but stationary flux.
- The 1n capacitor was initially pushing against the voltage-rise on the base
  of the BC547 but it now has a reverse-effect of allowing the BC547 to turn
  ON.
- This turns off the BD139 a little more and the current through the inductor
  reduces.
- This creates a collapsing flux that produces a voltage across the coil in the
  opposite direction. This voltage passes via the 1n to turn the BC547 ON and
  the BD139 is fully turned OFF.
- The inductor effectively becomes a miniature battery with negative on the
  lower LED and positive at the anode of the Ultra Fast diode. The voltage
  produced by the inductor flows through the UF diode and both 1-watt LEDs to
  give them a spike of high current. The circuit operates at approx 500kHz and
  this will depend on the inductance of the inductor.

The circuit has about 85% efficiency due to the absence of a current-limiting
resistor, and shuts off at 4v, thus preventing deep-discharge of the
rechargeable cells or 6v battery.

The clever part of the circuit is the white LED and two diodes. These
form a zener reference to turn the circuit off at 4v. The 10k resistor helps
too.

The circuit takes 70mA on low brightness and 120mA on HIGH brightness via
the brightness-switch.

The LEDs actually get 200mA pulses of current and this produces the high
brightness. 

### The Inductor

The coil or inductor is not critical. You can use a broken antenna rod from an
AM radio (or a flat antenna slab) or an inductor from a computer power supply.
Look for an inductor with a few turns of thick wire (at least 30) and you won't
have to re-wind it.

Here are two inductors from surplus outlets:

- <http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=G16521B> - 50 cents
- <http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/CR-345/345-UH-TOROIDAL-INDUCTOR/1.html> - 40cents

Here are the surplus inductors:

The cost of surplus is from 10 cents to 50 cents, but you are sure to find
something from a computer power supply.

Pick an inductor that is about 6mm to 10mm diameter and 10mm to 15mm high.
Larger inductor will not do any damage. They simply have more ferrite material
to store the energy and will not be saturated. It is the circuit that delivers
the energy to the inductor and then the inductor releases it to the LEDs via
the high speed diode.

### IMPROVEMENT

By using the following idea, the current reduces to 90mA and 70mA and the
illumination over a workbench is much better than a single high-power LED. It
is much brighter and much nicer to work under. Connect fifteen 5mm LEDs in
parallel (I used 20,000mcd LEDs) by soldering them to a double-sided strip of
PC board, 10mm wide and 300mm long. Space them at about 20mm. I know you
shouldn't connect LEDs in parallel, but the concept works very well in this
case. If some of the LEDs have a characteristic high voltage and do not
illuminate very brightly, simply replace them and use them later for another
strip. You can replace one or both the 1-watt LEDs with a LED Strip, as shown
below:

![LED Strip](images/LED-Strip.png)

### No current-limit resistor... Why isn't the LED damaged?

Here's why the LED isn't damaged: When the BD139 transistor turns ON, current
flows through the LEDs and the inductor. This current gradually increases due
to the gradual turning-on of the transistor and it is also increasing through
the inductor. The inductor also has an effect of slowing-down the "in-rush" of
current due to the expanding flux cutting the turns of the coil, so there is a
"double-effect" on avoiding a high initial current. That's why there is little
chance of damaging the LEDs. When it reaches 65mA, it produces a voltage of
.065 x 10 = 650mV across the 10R resistor, but the 1n is pushing against this
increase and it may have to rise to 150mA to turn on the BC547. LEDs can
withstand 4 times the normal current for very short periods of time and that's
what happens in this case. The BD139 is then turned off by the voltage produced
by the inductor due to the collapsing magnetic flux and a spike of high current
is passed to the LEDs via the high speed diode. During each cycle, the LEDs
receive two pulses of high current and this produces a very high brightness
with the least amount of energy from the supply. All the components run "cold"
and even the 1-watt LEDs are hardly warm. 

### Charging and Discharging

This project is designed to use all your old NiCad cells and mobile phone
batteries. It doesn't matter if you mix up sizes and type as the circuit takes
a low current and shuts off when the voltage is approx 4v for a 6v pack. If
you mix up 600mA-Hr cells with 1650mA-Hr, 2,000mA-Hr and 2,400mA-Hr, the lowest
capacity cell will determine the operating time. The capacity of a cells is
called "C." Normally, a cell is charged at the 14 hour-rate. The charging
current is 10% of the capacity. For a 600mA-Hr cell, this is 60mA. In 10 hours
it will be fully charged, but charging is not 100% efficient and so we allow
another 2 to 4 hours. For a 2,400mA-Hr cell, it is 240mA. If you charge them
faster than 14-hr rate, they will get HOT and if they get very hot, they may
leak or even explode. But this project is designed to be charged via a solar
panel using 100mA to 200mA cells, so nothing will be damaged. Ideally a
battery is discharged at C/10 rate. This means the battery will last 10 hours
and for a 600mA-Hr cell, this is 60mA. If you discharge it at the "C-rate," it
will theoretically last 1 hour and the current will be 600mA. But at 600mA, the
cells may only last 45 minutes. If you discharge is at C/5 rate, it will last 5
hours. Our project takes 120mA so no cell will be too-stressed. A 600mA-Hr
cell will last about 4-5 hours, while the other cells will last up to 24 hours.
Try to keep the capacity of each cell in a "battery-pack" equal.

If the length of a ferrite rod is too short, the magnetic material will
saturate and it will not accept any more current and it will start to produce
losses by heating-up. A toroid may work better because it will accept a higher
flux density because the magnetic path does not have an air gap. (a ferrite rod
is said to have an air-gap at the ends of the rod).

That's why a toroid will be smaller than a rod.

## 1.5 WATT LED

The circuit below can be modified to drive up to 30 white LEDs. 

![1.5wattLED](images/1w5_LED.png)

The effectiveness of a LED array increases when they are spread out slightly
and this makes them more efficient than a single 1 watt or 2 watt LED. 

The two modifications to the circuit make the BC337 work harder and this is the
limit of the inductor.  The current consumption is about 95mA.  The winding
details for the transformer are shown above.

## DRIVE 20 LEDs FROM 12v - approx 1watt circuit

![20LEDsParallel](images/20LEDsParallel.png)

This is another circuit that drives a number of LEDs or a single 1 watt LED. It
is a "Buck Circuit" and drives the LEDs in parallel. They should be graded so
that the characteristic voltage-drop across each of them is within 0.2v of all
the other LEDs. The circuit will drive any number from 1 to 20 by changing the
"sensor" resistor as shown on the circuit. The current consumption is about
95mA @ 12v and lower at 18v. The circuit can be put into dim mode by increasing
the drive resistor to 2k2.

The UF4004 is an ultra fast 1N4004 - similar to a high-speed diode.

You can use 2 x 1N4148 signal diodes.

The circuit will not drive two LEDs in series - it runs out of voltage (and
current) when the voltage across the load is 7v. It oscillates at approx
200kHz. Build both the 20 LED and 1 watt LED version and compare the brightness
and effectiveness.

The photo of the 1 watt LED on the left must be heatsinked to prevent the LED
overheating. The photo on the circuit diagram shows the LED mounted on a
heatsink and the connecting wires.

A 1-watt demo board showing the complex step-up circuitry.  This is a Boost
circuit to illuminate the LED and is completely different to our design.

It has been included to show the size of a 1 watt LED.

The reason for a Boost or Buck circuit to drive one or more LEDs is simple. The
voltage across a LED is called a "characteristic voltage" and comes as a
natural feature of the LED. We cannot alter it. To power the LED with exactly
the correct amount of voltage (and current) you need a supply that is EXACTLY
the same as the characteristic voltage. This is very difficult to do and so a
resistor is normally added in series. But this resistor wastes a lot of energy.
So, to keep the loses to a minimum, we pulse the LED with bursts of energy at a
higher voltage and the LED absorbs them and produces light. With a Buck
circuit, the transistor is turned on for a short period of time and illuminated
the LEDs. At the same time, some of the energy is passed to the inductor so
that the LEDs are not damaged. When the transistor is turned off, the energy
from the inductor also gives a pulse of energy to the LEDs. When this has been
delivered, the cycle starts again.

## BUCK CONVERTER for 3watt LED

![Buck Converter for 3watt LED Schematics](images/BuckConverter3watt.png)

This circuit drives a 3watt LED. You have to be careful not to damage the LED
when setting up the circuit. Add a 10R to the supply rail and hold it in your
fingers. Make sure it does not get too hot and monitor the voltage across the
resistor. Each 1v represents 100mA. The circuit will work and nothing will be
damaged. If the resistor "burns your fingers" you have a short circuit.

The BC557 multivibrator has a "mark-to-space ratio" determined by the 22n and 33k,
compared to the 100n and 47k, producing about 3:1. The BD679 is turned ON for
about 30% of the time. This produces a very bright output, and takes about
170mA for 30% of the time. You cannot measure this current with a meter as it
reads the peak value and the reading will be totally false. The only way to
view the waveform is on a CRO, and calculate the current.

The 100-turn inductor allows the BD679 turn turn ON fully and "separates" the
voltage on the emitter of the BC679 from the voltage on the top of the 3watt
LED.

When the BD679 turns ON, the emitter rises to about 10v. But the top of the LED
**NEVER** rises above 3.6v. The inductor "buffers" or "separates" these two
voltages by producing a voltage across the winding equal to 6.4v and that's why
the LED is not damaged.

When the transistor turns off (for 60% of the time), the magnetic flux produced
by the current in the inductor collapses and produces a voltage in the opposite
direction. This means the inductor now becomes a miniature battery and for a
very short period of time it produces energy to illuminate the LED. The top of
the inductor becomes negative and the bottom is positive. The current flows
through the LED and through the Ultra High-Speed 1N4004 diode to complete the
circuit. Thus the circuit takes advantage of the energy in the inductor.

A 500R pot is placed across the LED and a voltage is picked off the pot to turn
on a BC547 transistor. This transistor "robs" some of the "turn-on" for the
BD679 transistor to reduce the brightness of the LED.

Because the circuit is driving the LED with pulses, very high brightness is
obtained with a low current. Our eyes detect peak brightness and you can
compare the performance of this circuit with a DC driven LED.

## CONSTANT CURRENT DRIVES TWO 3WATT LEDs

![ConstantCurrent5wLEDs](images/ConstantCurrent5wLEDs.png)

This constant current circuit is designed to drive two 3-watt Luxeon LEDs. The
LEDs require 1,000mA (1Amp) and have a characteristic voltage-drop across them
of about 3.8v. Approximately 4v is dropped across the LM317T regulator and
1.25v across the current-limiting resistors, so the input voltage (supply) has
to be 12.85v. A 12v battery generally delivers 12.6v.

The LM 317T 3-terminal regulator will need to be heatsinked.

This circuit is designed for the LM series of regulator as they have a voltage
differential of 1.25v between "adj" and "out" terminals.

## AUTOMATIC GARDEN LIGHT

![AutoGardenLight](images/AutoGardenLight.png)

This circuit automatically turns on and illuminates the LEDs when the solar
panel does not detect any light. It switches off when the solar panel produces
more than 1v and charges the battery when the panel produces more than 1.5v +
0.6v = 2.1v

## AUTOMATIC BATHROOM LIGHT or PASSAGE LIGHT

by Samuel Budiyanto <budiyantosamuel90@gmail.com>.

![EmergencyLamp](images/EmergencyLamp.png)

This circuit is for all those who experience black-outs and "power-outs".

It uses a 5v charger from an old mobile phone to trickle charge a 3.6v cell or
2 x lead acid cells.

Use a small toroid about 40mm diameter or a 10mm ferrite rod 40mm long and
0.25mm wire. Keep the charge to 10mA to 20mA and the LEDs will come on every
time the power fails. My circuit has been working for the past 7 months. If the
LEDs don't illuminate with equal brightness, change them around and they will
equalise.

## AUTOMATIC SOLAR LIGHT

![AutoSolarLight](images/AutoSolarLight.png)

This circuit automatically turns on and illuminates the LEDs when the solar
panel does not detect any light. It switches off when the solar panel produces
more than 0.5v above the battery voltage.

You can use any number of white LEDs. LEDS should not be connected in parallel,
however they work if you selects LEDs that produce the same brightness. Any
dull LEDs can be used in another circuit.

When the solar panel receives sunlight, the voltage on the base of the
transistor keeps it turned OFF. When the panel receives no illumination, the
470R and 1k resistors turn the transistor ON.

You can use a 6v 0.5watt or 1 watt solar panel and the first circuit uses an
NPN transistor while the second circuit uses a PNP transistor.

The output of the solar panel automatically adjusts to the voltage of the
battery and as more light is detected by the panel, the current increases.

A 0.5watt panel contains 100mA cells and a 1watt panel contains 200mA cells.

The battery can have any capacity from 600mAHr to 1800mAHr.

We are assuming the battery is used all night and is flat in the morning.

A 600mAHr battery will take 6-8 hours to fully charge with a 0.5watt panel and
a 1800mAHr battery will take 2 days to charge with a 1 watt panel.

Each white LED requires about 20mA for good brightness and the 47R resistor
will have to be adjusted to suit the battery voltage and the number of LEDs.

The third circuit uses a 12v 0.5watt or 1 watt solar panel and the circuit is
much more efficient as 3 white LEDs can be connected in series for each 20mA of
current.

## 27MHz DOOR PHONE

This circuit turns a walkie talkie into a handy wireless door phone. It saves
wiring and the receiver can be taken with you upstairs or outside, without
loosing a call from a visitor.

A 5-Transistor walkie talkie can be used (see [5 TRANSISTOR WALKIE TALKIE 1] above) and the
modifications made to the transmitter and receiver are shown below:

### THE TRANSMITTER

![27MHzDoorPhone-Tx-1Cct](images/27MHzDoorPhone-Tx-1Cct.png)

Only three sections of the transmit/ receive switch are used in the walkie
talkie circuit and our modification uses the fourth section. Cut the tracks to
the lands of the unused section so it can be used for our circuit.  There are a
number of different printed circuit boards on the market, all using the same
circuit and some will be physically different to that shown in the photo. But
one of the sections of the switch will be unused.  Build the 2-transistor delay
circuit and connect it to the walkie talkie board as shown. When the
"push-to-talk" switch is pressed, the PC board will be activated as the delay
circuit effectively connects the negative lead of the battery to the negative
rail of the board for about 30 seconds.  The 100u gradually discharges via the
1M after the "press-to-talk" switch is released and the two transistors turn
off and the current drops to less than 1 micro-amp - that's why the power
switch can be left on. .

The transmitter walkie talkie is placed at the front door and the power switch
is turned on. To call, push the "push-to-talk" switch and the "CALL" button at
the same time for about 5 seconds. The circuit will activate and when the
"push-to-talk" switch is released, the circuit will produce background noise
for about 30 seconds and you will hear when call is answered.

The "push-to-talk" switch is then used to talk to the other end and this will
activate the circuit for a further 30 seconds. If the walkie talkie does not
have a "CALL" switch, 3 components can be added to provide feedback, as shown
in the circuit below, to produce a tone.

### THE RECEIVER

![27MHzDoorPhone-Rx-1Cct](images/27MHzDoorPhone-Rx-1Cct.png)

The receiver circuit needs modification and a 2-transistor circuit is added.
This circuit detects the tone and activates the 3-transistor direct-coupled
amplifier so that the speaker produces a tone.

The receiver circuit is switched on and the 2-transistor circuit we connect to
the PC board effectively turns on the 3-transistor amplifier so that the
quiescent current drops from 10mA to about 2-3mA. It also mutes the speaker as
the amplifier is not activated. The circuit remains on all the time so it will
be able to detect a "CALL." When a tone is picked up by the first two
transistors in the walkie talkie, it is passed to the first transistor in our
"add-on" section and this transistor produces a signal with sufficient
amplitude to remove the charge on the 1u electrolytic. This switches off the
second transistor and this allows the 3-transistor amplifier to pass the tone
to the speaker. The operator then slides a switch called "OPERATE" to ON (down)
and this turns on the 3-transistor amplifier. Pressing the "push-to-talk"
switch (labelled T/R) allows a conversation with the person at the door. Slide
the "OPERATE" switch up when finished.

## SCHMITT TRIGGER

![SchmittTrigger](images/SchmittTrigger.png)

A Schmitt Trigger is any circuit that has a fast change-over from one state to
the other. In our case we have used 2 transistors to produce this effect and
the third is an emitter-follower buffer.

The circuit will drive a LED or relay and the purpose is to turn the LED ON
quickly at a particular level of illumination and OFF at a higher level. The
gap between ON and OFF is called the HYSTERESIS GAP.

## SCHMITT TRIGGER 2

![SchmittTrigger-2](images/SchmittTrigger-2.png)

The following circuit is a Schmitt Trigger made with NPN and PNP transistors:

## SCHMITT TRIGGER 3

![SchmittTrigger-3](images/SchmittTrigger-3.png)

The following circuit is another Schmitt Trigger made with NPN and PNP
transistors. The 100k "stop resistor" on the 100k prevents the circuit turning
ON when the pot is near the supply rail.

## PHONE TAPE 1

![PhoneTape](images/PhoneTape.png)

This simple circuit will allow you to tape-record a conversation from a phone
line.

It must be placed between the plug on the wall and the phone.  The easiest way
is to cut an extension lead. Wind 300-500 turns of 0.095mm wire on a plastic
straw and place the reed switch inside. Start with 300 turns and see if the
reed switch activates, Keep adding turns until the switch is reliable.

Fit two 100n capacitors to the ends of the winding for the audio.  Plug the
Audio into "Mic" on tape recorder. Plug the remote into "remote" on the tape
recorder and push "record." The tape recorder will turn on when the phone is
lifted and record the conversation.

## PHONE TAPE 2

![PhoneTape-2](images/PhoneTape-2.png)

The circuit is turned off when the phone line is 45v as the voltage divider
made up of the 470k, 1M and 100k puts 3.5v on the base of the first BC557
transistor. If you are not able to cut the lead to the phone, the circuit above
will record a conversation from an extension lead. The remote plug must be
wired around the correct way for the motor to operate.

## PHONE ALERT

![PhoneAlert](images/PhoneAlert.png)

Two circuits are available to show when a phone is being used. The first
circuit must be placed between the socket on the wall and the phone - such as
cutting into the lead and insert the bridge and diode.

But if you cannot cut the lead to the phone, you will have to add an extension
cord and place the second circuit at the end of the line. You can also connect
a phone at the end if needed.

## PHONE ALERT-2 (for mobile phone)

![PhoneAlert-2Cct](images/PhoneAlert-2Cct.png)

This circuit detects the RF when the phone is communicating with the tower
during the hand-shaking prior to it ringing.

The 1SS86 is a Silicon Schottky Barrier Diode for UHF circuits and is 100 times
more sensitive than a 1N4148 signal diode. Many of the "clone" 1SS86 diodes
(fake or really another type of diode) sold on eBay NOT NOT WORK. The
characteristics of the 1SSS86 are really amazing.

This is an ideal circuit to test different diodes.  The first transistor is
biased ON and the signal (waveform) developed across the coil takes the cathode
end of the diode NEGATIVE for part of the cycle and this puts a slightly lower
voltage on the left lead of the 10n capacitor. The right-lead follows and a
slightly lower voltage is applied to the base of the transistor. The transistor
turns OFF slightly and this effect is passed to the other two transistors to
flash the LED.

With 1N4148, the phone must be 10cm from the project. With a 1SS86 it can be
one metre away. The circuit takes about 1mA.

![PhoneAlert-2](images/PhoneAlert-2.png)

A kit is available from Talking Electronics for $3.00 plus $4.50 postage. The
project is built on Matrix Board as shown in the drawing above.

## THE LISTENER

![Listener](images/Listener.png)

This circuit consists of a 4-transistor amplifier and a 3-transistor "switch"
that detects when the phone line is in use, and turns on the amplifier.  The
voltage divider at the front end produces about 11v on the base of the first
BC557 and this keeps the transistor off.

Switch the unit off when removed from the phone line.

## PHONE TRANSMITTER 1

see also [PHONE BUG] circuit.

![Phone Transmitter Schematics](images/PhoneTransmitter-1.png)

The circuit will transmit a phone conversation to an FM radio on the 88-108MHz
band. It uses energy from the phone line to transmit about 100metres. It uses
the phone wire as the antenna and is activated when the phone is picked up. The
components are mounted on a small PC board and the lower photo clearly shows
the track-work.

## PHONE TRANSMITTER 2

![PhoneTransmitter-2](images/PhoneTransmitter-2.png)

The circuit will transmit a phone conversation to an FM radio on the 88-108MHz
band. It uses energy from the phone line to transmit about 200metres. It uses
the phone wire as the antenna and is activated when the phone is picked up.

## PHONE TRANSMITTER 3

see also [PHONE BUG] circuit.

![PhoneTransmitter-3](images/PhoneTransmitter-3.png)

This circuit has poor features but you can try it and see how it performs. It
uses a PNP transistor and requires a separate antenna. It also has a supply of
less than 1.9v, via the red LED. It would be better to put 2 LEDs in series to
get a higher voltage. It is activated when the phone is picked up.

<!-- full -->![](images/PhoneTx-3.jpg)

## PHONE TRANSMITTER 4

![PhoneTransmitter-4](images/PhoneTransmitter-4.png)

see also Phone Bug (101-200 circuits)

The circuit was originally designed by me and presented in Poptronics magazine.
It will transmit a phone conversation to an FM radio on the 88-108MHz band. It
uses energy from the phone line to transmit about 200metres and uses the phone
wire as the antenna. It is activated when the phone is picked up. The 22p air
trimmer is shown as well as the 3 coils. Q2 is a buffer transistor between the
oscillator and phone line and will provide a higher output than the previous
circuits.

## MUSIC ON HOLD

![Audio](images/Audio.png)

This simple circuit delivers audio to the phone line from the "audio-out" of a
tape recorder or radio.

Adjust the volume control of the radio to produce a suitable level of audio.

Use 400v capacitors to be on the safe-side.

## ROBOT-1

![Robot-1](images/Robot-1.png)

A simple robot can be made with 2 motors and two light-detecting circuits,
(identical to the circuit above). The robot is attracted to light and when the
light dependent resistor sees light, its resistance decreases. This turns on
the BC547 and also the BC557. The shaft of the motor has a rubber foot that
contacts the ground and moves the robot. The two pots adjust the sensitivity of
the LDRs. This kit is available from Velleman as kit number MK127.

## SWITCH DEBOUNCER and PULSE PRODUCER

![SwDebounce](images/SwDebounce.png)

Thus is one of the simplest and cleverest circuits ever produced (by Ron:
<http://www.zen22142.zen.co.uk/ronj/tg1.html>). Ron says:
